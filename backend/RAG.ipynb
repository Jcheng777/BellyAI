The décor broadcasts this place exudes a fantastic vibe.\\n\\nWe started with 2 gin cocktails: She's A Keeper and the Smokey. My wife thoroughly enjoyed hers. The Smokey was absolutely outstanding--a perfectly balanced cocktail with smokey gin and rosemary that truly elevated the flavor profile of this drink.\\n\\nFor lunch, we shared 2 dishes: the Tuna Tartare and the New York Soppressata Flatbread. Food was great and came fast! It was just the right amount of food to fuel us for a long walk around Manhattan afterward.\\n\\nValerie's cocktails and the ambiance make it a must-visit spot. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a chic yet relaxed lunch experience in the Manhattan!\", \"Valerie isn't all just show. The restaurant may be a ploy to entice fellow tourist passerby-ers to come in but it's far from being basic.\\n\\nThe restaurant had beautiful lights and a wonderful singer in the front that was filling the space of the restaurant very nicely. \\n\\nFor my brunch I ordered the steak and eggs, while my s/o  ordered the fried chicken eggs Benedict. We absolutely demolished our food and wiped the plates clean. The price standpoint for the quality of food in NY was worth it. You've got to stop by!! We recommend this restaurant for brunch but be sure to MAKE RESERVATIONS BEFOREHAND!!\", 'Came in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch without a reservation for a party of four. Just a short wait before we were seated. It turns out they only do brunch then and the menu was somewhat limited. \\n\\nThe party ordered the Valerie burger (3 of them) and the crab Benedict. I have to say, the service was very slow as we waited almost 30 minutes for our food to be prepared. \\n\\nOnce it finally arrived, it was nicely plated and tasted good, but not great. Given the other reviews, I was hoping for better to be honest.', \"I really enjoyed my experience here. Lunch menu didn't have too many vegetarian options but they are very accommodating. They removed the meat from my flatbread and I enjoyed it! The ambience is beautiful, they nicely decorated for the holidays. I would definitely visit again.\", \"Nice restaurant, probably a good date spot. \\n\\nI had the Cuban sandwich. It was different from the classic Cuban sandwich i grew up with in Miami. But this is the first good Cuban sandwich I've had in NYC or even Union City. It was different but delicious. My wife is Cuban and she had a bite and really liked it, so I feel like that's the real seal of approval. \\n\\nMy wife had the lunch Burger. It was cooked to a perfect medium-rare as requested. She upgraded to the truffle fries. She enjoyed all of it. \\n\\nI would eat her again. I would have the Cuban sandwich again.\", \"What a lovely place for happy hour! The interior is so elegant, and the vibe is cozy yet lively. We went during the holiday season, and the decorations were so festive.\\n\\nThe cocktails were delicious - both the Spanish Gin and Tonic and the Royal Pimm's Cup were sweet and paired well with the charcuterie board we ordered. It was very fun to try the different cheeses and meats.\\n\\nThe staff was extremely friendly, and the service was fast. I would definitely recommend snagging a reservation at Valerie for happy hour :)\", \"We came here for lunch and were ecstatic to find out they were still serving brunch at 1pm (on a Saturday). The place itself is beautiful and very well decorated and I adore the drink menus, inspired by vintage. The drinks took a little to be made but we watched the entire process at the bar and saw how much went into each one. The avocado toast was good, very thick bread and the honey comb/pistachios tied it together perfectly, I do wish something on it was hot...maybe the toast itself.  You absolutely MUST get the crab cake benedict- easily the best one I've ever had.\", 'Nicely decorated for the holidays with a festive atmosphere without being overly crowded. \\n\\nWe had the Valerie Burger (with excellent Truffle Fries that we upgraded to) and Short Ribs and both were great.\\n\\nThe Crème Brulee was solid for dessert and about the only miss was the Chocolate Feuillant which was a little too dense for us.\\n\\nVery friendly service and our server Ashleigh was terrific.', \"Lovely festive decoration, cordial host, good service.. but sorry, the food was really mediocre. Went there for Thanksgiving night, and I though, let's get the special Thanksgiving turkey. Hmm..my father in law's turkey is better than that. My hubby who ordered lamb shank said his food was also just alright.\\nI might come back to give their regular menu a try, or to just hang out at the bar.\", \"We stumbled upon Valerie for a spontaneous lunch, and I'm so glad we did! \\n\\nSERVICE - The service was great right from the start. We quickly made reservations as we walked in, and the waitstaff was friendly and efficient.\\n\\nFOOD\\nWhipped Feta - a simple yet fun dish that really set the tone. \\n\\nCaesar Salad - was fresh and added a nice crunch to our meal.\\n\\nPesto and Prosciutto Flatbread - had a lovely balance of sweet and savory flavors. It was a delightful twist that we really enjoyed.\\n\\nBlack Truffle Bucatini - it was incredible! The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was both savory and creamy, with flavors that melded beautifully together.\\n\\nOverall, Valerie is a fantastic lunch spot that I'd happily return to!\", 'Had a 10:15 reservation after wicked. Semi-busy downstairs when we got there, and it was mass confusion at the hostess station. We ended up stuck in a corner upstairs, near a couple who had been over-served and their volume levels at 100. It was max pain for most of our time. I feel bad for the waitress dealing with them. We waited nearly 10 minutes for water. Ordered our drinks and food at that time as well. Everything seemed slow, and it was only us and the loud couple upstairs. The drink menu is overwhelming. We went with standards instead, Dirty Martinis, Old fashioned, Cosmos. Drinks were fine, albeit small in volume and a little thin on heat. We really didnt have time to do much more than Burgers/fries/flatbread based on the time of night and kitchen closing at 11pm, so this review is less about the food (although the burger was solid), and more about the drinks and experience.\\n\\nThe vibe was cool when we walked in. But overall, pretty disappointing.', \"This place was very inviting. \\nThey were also standing bar room only. But they at least pretending to look for a table for us. \\nThe hostess was kind and made us feel welcome. \\nWe sat at the bar & we were able to order from the menu. \\nKitchen closes at 11:45pm \\n\\nWe got several  cocktails \\nValerie is a gin bar so most of they're cocktails are catered to gin. They have a pretty big drink menu,which is fun if youre an adventurous drinker. \\n\\nCrabcake was delicious, however it's $30 for 1 so it's hard to justify but it was good the celery topping was pleasant and different. \\n\\nThe steak and fries were very good \\nWe got the truffle fries for $2 extra. \\nSteak was thick and perfectly medium rare, rosemary compound butter. \\nFries were delicious, Parmesany, I honestly couldn't find a truffle flavor I'm not that familiar with truffle but the fries were tasty. \\n\\nHighly recommend making reservations for this place.\", \"It was cold outside for the Bryant Park  Holiday Market. We wanted to get warm and stumbled on this place, Valieries' was warm and inviting . I enjoyed the avocado hummus. \\nI liked the relaxing decor. I will definitely return\", \"Super pretty inside and such a great cocktail bar to go grab a drink. I'm not a huge heavy gin drinker, but majority of their menu drinks gin in them. \\n\\nI got the pollinated and the forbidden river and they were both quite good \\n\\nService is quick and they are quite helpful if you are confused, on what to get! \\n\\nSide note: I am not an espresso martini drinker, but my friends that got it all said that it was the best one they've ever had.\", \"Ordered:\\nSpanish G&T (~$12 - HH price)\\nHalf Dozen East Coast Oysters ($1 each - HH price): with drink purchase\\n\\nAya's take:\\nWe as New Yorkers need to go back to great Happy Hour deals and I'm glad places like Valerie are still offering great pre-dinner drinks & bites to enjoy at a great price! I stopped by with a friend during Happy Hour which is weekdays from 4-7pm. Most of the tables were pushed out of the way so we stood by the bar and eventually went upstairs to sit by the bar since they had some available chairs. Valerie has plenty of cocktails that look & sound amazing, I wish some of those were on the HH menu. Nonetheless, the Spanish G&T was really solid! It's dry, slightly citrusy, and has a variety of garnishes. It was a nice drink to sip on that's low calorie and low in sugar. The East Coast Oysters were super fresh and tasty. At $1 a piece, it's a steal! Great spot for Happy Hour, definitely recommend it.\", 'Tucked in Midtown Manhattan, Valerie masterfully blends contemporary American cuisine with an impressive cocktail program in a sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere.\\n\\nThe combination of well-executed food, expert cocktails, and elegant ambiance makes it a standout in Midtown\\'s competitive dining scene.\\n\\nHere\\'s a fun, personal take on Valerie. So there I was, rolling into Valerie with my friends, thinking \"Oh great, another Midtown spot that\\'s gonna give us attitude and tiny portions.\" Boy, was I wrong!\\n\\nFirst off, our server (who had the energy of a Broadway performer on opening night) actually treated us like we were VIPs, not just another group of hungry New Yorkers.\\n\\nThey were so attentive, I think they knew I was thinking about a drink refill before I did!\\n\\nBest part? Unlike most Midtown restaurants where you need to sell a kidney to afford dinner, the prices here are actually... reasonable? (Did I just use \"reasonable\" and \"Midtown\" in the same sentence? Yes, yes I did.)', \"Very cool place for a drink before dinner.  Beautiful bar, inspired cocktails and an overall nice atmosphere- vibrant but not crazy.  It's a bit of an upscale place, several groups in black tie / gowns.  Very nice bartenders and hostess.\", \"Just came back to say . . . wanted to give this place another try (mainly because I had a late Broadway play and Lolita was closing earlier).  The cocktails are still fun, creative, and taste pretty good, though there are better in the city.  Easy to make a reservation for 11 PM on a Wednesday.  Hostess was super nice, seated right away.  My server was much nicer this time and made good recommendations.\\n\\nI started with the spinach and artichoke dip, served with tortilla chips.  Not terrible, but not seasoned and a little watery.  I did not pick up on the wild mushrooms.  Nothing else on the entree side caught my eye, so I got the steak frites again.  Again, meh, it was mid--better than some, not as good as others.\\n\\nI'm hesitant to get something like the New York soppressata flatbread because other places probably do it better.  But maybe I'm wrong or made a mistake.  Maybe they would do a good roasted halibut, but I'm picky about my fish.  Maybe if I come here again (which, given how many shows I have over the next two months, is a possibility), I'll try the burger.  Made with French onion jam, American or white cheddar, and bacon, it might be a good bet.\\n\\nBut we all know my relationship with Valerie is one of convenience when I'm in midtown . . . and I'll probably always be more likely to steal away to her sultry sister, Lolita.\\n\\nBut short of being in the area for a production . . . New York has so much to offer overall.\", 'BEST CHEESEBURGER IVE EVER HAD!!!!!!\\nAnd once it came, any table within eye lined ordered the same thing and we were all salivating! \\n\\nCousin had the steak and it was DELICIOUS!!', \"LOVED IT HERE WOW!!! The second you walk in, you will be astonished. I was lucky enough to experience the Christmas decor and it just feels so warm and incredible. If you like gin, don't walk here... run. The gin selection and menu style is one of a kind. Sooo many options and presentation is 10/10. All of the food was yummy and beyond expectations. Our waitress was so fun and was the cherry on top. I recommend this place to everyone\\nAnd check out their speakeasy next door: Madame George. I fell in absolute love with it!\", \"A very atmospheric bar restaurant, we visited after a Broadway show, it is a very good combination. The drinks,  service and atmosphere are fantastic, 1 star is missed out of 5 because of the food. \\n\\nOur expectations considering everything else were higher! Still it's excellent for drinks and especially for gin lovers (as we are) since it offers an astonishing selection of gin based cocktails.\", 'Nice ambiance with a jazz quartet playing during Sunday brunch. Good selection of spirits. Cocktails are competently made. \\n\\nThe downside is painfully slow and rather brusque service at the bar.', \"Micah is a great restaurant and I came here on the recommendation of a friend. The interior design of the place is great and it's a good place to go for some friends who want to relax.\\n\\nFor food I ordered the Cuban sandwich, which is totally different from the Cuban sandwich I had in CA, but bigger and tastier. I enjoyed that and then I ordered a vegetable salad. The flavours were great.\\n\\nThe waitresses were also very welcoming and attentive and my water glass was always noticed. I will be coming back again.\", \"Huge bar, great drinks and great eats (we didn't eat but wanted to). We sat at the bar and the service was great from our bartender. There is a holiday decor vibe in here which we loved too. \\n\\nThe fries that we wanted to order came in a huge bowl. Love it when great restaurants don't skimp on fries. \\n\\nThis place has a huge gin menu. So give it a try. I had the Earl grey which was good but really couldn't do more than half a glass. \\n\\nPlenty of beer and liquor options too.\", \"Marley, not to be confused with Bob Marley, or Jacob Marley, rocks bartender hospitality, in  a big way. Fabulous cocktail mixology, even if she thinks that's an unnecessary thing to call her a mixologist. \\n\\nThe steak frites was perfectly cooked. Ambience is always great here. Open late for dinner, it's worth the short walk from the theatre district.\", \"What a vibe at this NYC spot!! The decor is amazing and visual eye candy! We did not have a Resi but the hostess sat us at the upstairs bar overlooking the lower bar. The drinks were superb and the bartender was fun and the service attentive but not overwhelming. We got apps, the spinach dip was so good I could've ate 2 of them! We split the prosciutto pizza which was full of flavor and a perfect crust. I will definitely be back for dinner!!\", 'Valerie is a great spot for a small bite and a delicious drink. One of my favorite items is their truffle fries, paired with their extensive gin and tonic selection. They also own a charming speakeasy next door, offering a more old-school vibe with live music--a perfect place to continue the evening.', \"Come for the ambiance and the live jazz! It's a beautifully decorated restaurant inside and out. Sundays 11-3pm. The band takes a break every hour, but they really put on a show when they perform! Ask for the high top tables across from the bar for the best views. \\n\\nFood wise, it was very average. The idea was good, but execution and quality was mediocre at best. For such a beautiful environment and thoughtful menu, I would've thought the quality of food would've been better. \\n\\nComplimentary scones with jam and butter - these scones tasted like the McDonald's biscuits. Had the artificial aftertaste as well. A little moist on the outside and served cold. It would've been nice if they had warmed it up. the berry compote was more on the runny side. \\n\\nFrench omelette with crab lump salad ($21) - omelette was like a low-quality hotel breakfast buffet omelette. Had a faint egg flavor, it seems like the eggs were watered down. The eggs were moist and fluffy, but visually could've been rolled into a cylinder like  a traditional French omelette as well. Crab salad was very wet and tasted like was from a can. Salad was good, but breakfast potatoes seemed like they were just the leftover scraps from the plate before. For the price, it's okay. But I would try something else next time. \\n\\nDutch baby pancakes ($16) - crispy on the outside but a bit dry inside. It seems like the pancake didn't inflate much. The berry compote was a bit watery. And the rose apples were just okay. \\n\\nAll in all, I would come back for the jazz and grabbing a drink. They bar is beautiful and had an extensive bar menu. Food wise, the pricepoint is fair, but not crave-worthy.\", 'Feeling like getting some brunch we stopped in at Valerie. They asked if we had reservations, but when we said, \"No,\" they ushered us right in. \\n\\nGood service. They gave us biscuits with butter and berry jam shortly after we arrived. Those were good. I ordered the Lump Crab Omelette with pork sausage on the side. It was a good sized portion with the omelette, three hashbrown triangles, and a small salad.  \\n\\nEverything tasted good, and we got plenty to eat. Also, I tried their Bloody Mary (virgin), and it was excellent. A nice housemade mix with lots of flavor.', 'We stopped in after a Matinee for an early dinner. This is a great spot. The service was top notch and food good. They have good happy hour with good deals such as the $1 oysters. The Crab cake is a good start and the highlight of the meal is the burger. It was cooked well and good flavor. The Stripped bass was great as well and cooked well. This is a good choice for any ore theater or after for a meal.', \"My friends and I came on a weekday evening. We got a nice corner spot, which was still loud but likely better than most other tables for sound.\\n\\nThe menu is on the shorter side. It leans relatively aquatic/seafood. \\n\\nThe gin and tonic happy hour drink was great! What a deal. There were a lot of awesome options, but I had to go for a drink deal.\\n\\nI'm still dreaming of the octopus salad. It was so fresh and great for the season. I also thought the spinach artichoke dip, which also had mushrooms, was a delight. The pork buns were a little expensive for what they were, I'd say, but they were tasty. There was one vegetable dish we really wanted that was not available, which was disappointing, but the broccolini side was great. \\n\\nOur waiter was nice and fairly attentive.\", \"This place is beautiful on the inside and has delicious food to go with it. The price, while not exorbitant, is high-ish for a quick lunch, but this isn't best suited for a quick lunch. You'll want to soak in the vibe, especially in the back room, and keep getting drinks.\", \"So so glad I booked a table at Valerie!! The place was packed at 6pm on a weekday! The acoustics are not too good so it can be quite loud. It didn't faze us though. Their happy hour was still going on and was able to do it at our table which was a score! Got $1 oysters and $12 drinks. Oysters were free of sand and shells, tasty. Beverages were great. Vodka gimlet and Pimm's Cup. \\n\\nThe stars were definitely the bone in short rib and the burger!! The short rib was huge. Falling off the bone. Tender and moist. Burger was cooked perfectly, seasoned well. Fries were fantastic!! Ask for an extra garlic aioli. Best I've had! Can't wait to go back for dinner.\", \"I've only been here for brunch, and it was a spacious and classy spot with live music and good food. I enjoyed the biscuits (which the table shared) and the croque madame, and I recommend both! I heard this place is a good spot for drinks after work so I'll be back!\", \"Valerie was pleasant overall, great atmosphere that felt like a bit of an escape from the midtown hustle.\\n\\nThe restaurant is upstairs from the impressive cocktail bar that welcomes you when you first walk in. The space is lovely, with an intimate, art deco vibe that feels refined.\\n\\nThe cocktails were definitely the highlight! They have quite a few gin-based drinks, as well as some seasonal cocktails. Lots of interesting flavors in there!\\n\\nThe food was only so-so. We started with oysters, which were good. But the mains were underwhelming. I had one of the flatbreads, (New York Soppressata) and it was pretty oily, without much flavor. The salmon belly avocado toast was massive, but again, didn't stand out.\\n\\nAll in all, not a bad option, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.\", \"I've been to Valerie's other locations in Hells Kitchen and Union square and this one was just as good. The waitress was a bit slow, but overall we had a good experience. The holiday decor was on display and was festive and tastefully done. The food was really good... the truffle fries were ordered were a bit on the salty side, but my chicken Milanese sandwich was tender and flavorful, and the salad that I ordered with it was really good too. This a great Midtown option when looking for a nice place to dine or grab a drink.\", \"I've been to Valerie a few times for happy hour and dinner, and I recently went for brunch with a group of friends. It's a solid place in general. The food is delicious, I have generally found the service to be great as well. The only minor thing to note is that it can get very packed and extremely loud during happy hour, so if you want to actually have a conversation with multiple people, it may be better to go once the HH groups clear out. This could also just mean I'm old. :) Brunch was a lot more low key, and they had live jazz, which was a nice touch!\", \"Made a reservation here for lunch after leaving SiriusXM studios. We were celebrating a recent Grammy nomination with the band. The staff was awesome, very friendly and attentive, and the food was amazing. We started with the melt in your mouth spinach and artichoke dip, perfectly flavored tuna tartare and the avocado hummus. Followed that up with an assortment of entrees- all of which were very good- from the pepperoni & burrata pizza, to the quinoa salad, open faced ahi tuna to the burger- everyone loved the food. Our accompanying cocktails were on point and we ended our meal with a celebratory champagne toast. Highly recommend visiting this restaurant. Can't wait to return.\", \"The staff at Valerie was nice and our reservation went seamlessly. However, the food and drinks were lackluster. Our entrees were average, but the spinach & artichoke dip was confusing at best. It was unseasoned and seemingly made up of only spinach and mushrooms (and a heaping helping of arugula?)- I truly don't know if there was a single piece of artichoke.\", 'Valerie is a good spot in the Theater District for brunch or an early dinner before seeing a show. The service is good. The ambiance is fine, but better to snag a seat at the very nice bar upfront if you can.', \"We came here for dinner before heading to a show given its proximity to the theater and its great reviews!\\n\\nIt was packed when we arrived - largely fueled by happy hour and some type of work function! We sat next to an obnoxious women who had her legs up in half splits lying across the seat pretty much touching our table with her dirty boots up on the seats! Like when is that ever appropriate?!! So gross!\\n\\nThey have a very comprehensive drink - particularly gin - menu with lots of options ! Mine sounded as though it would be herbal but it tasted just like a regular G&T to me albeit with a hint of orange bitters! It was good but not memorable!\\n\\nWe enjoyed the Happy Hour oysters which are a great deal at $1 a piece and they were pretty good! They looked liked they had been shucked -albeit poorly - a while ago and all the liquid was gone which is part of the oyster experience but for $12 a dozen - still a great deal but a couple looked iffy and we left them!\\n\\nThe two standouts were the Tuna Tartare which was excellent and a very generous portion and the avocado hummus which ended up being my favorite dish of the night! Very flavorful and served with lots of fresh veggies!\\n\\nTruffle fries were good but nothing to write home about, squash blossoms were a bit bland and too heavy, ,but for me the big let down was the Hamachi Crudo - my piece was quite fishy, it lacked seasoning or enough acid and weirdly was served with an activated charcoal broth - given that it's largely a detox supplement, it was an odd choice that did nothing to compliment the dish and left our plates an unappetizing black color ! That dish was just not great for me !\\n\\nFun restaurant however and most of the meal was great, loved the cool decor and good service l! Very well priced for downtown Manhattan!\", \"Two stars one for each item that was solid which was the octopus appetizer and the drinks were decent.\\n\\nFast forward to entrees:\\nHalibut (0/5) \\nZero flavor, overcooked. I tasted the fish, sunchoke, asparagus, mushrooms individually together added pepper. Nothing. Fish was so overdone they killed it thrice. \\n\\n\\nSquid ink pasta with shrimp (3/5)\\nDecent flavor but everything pasta was overcooked. Pasta soft, shrimp ok sauce good. \\n\\nReally disappointed at paying the amount we did for no flavor.\\nWould maybe come for a drink and fries and appetizer. Don't bother with the entrees \\n\\nVisually lovely. But your tastebuds will feel deceived.\", 'Really wanted to like this place. Walked in and immediately loved it. The ambiance was perfect.  It had a great fragrance and lots of gin that I love but then it went down after that. Service was meh. Our server literally went on break during our lunch. Which could be fine but she didn\\'t tell us, neither did anyone say they were covering for her. I had to wave another server down to ask for a drink. My daughter\\'s salad had no dressing and we had to ask one of the bus boys for dressing. My sister ordered a cocktail and wanted another but again no server. \\nWhen she finally returned and I asked what happened to her she joyfully said \"I went on break\" . With no apology for her absence and disrupting our service. Totally disappointed in my service. \\nThe food was not great because my salad was dry, burger cold, just not a great experience.', \"Came here with friends for dinner before a comedy show. Although we got our own dishes, we also shared samples of each. \\n\\nThe truffle fries were good, crisp, not too oily; though feel like most of the truffle flavor relied on the truffle aioli, which was in it of itself tasty. \\n\\nThe NY sopressetta flatbread was my favorite dish. It's like a mini pizza, but with a flatbread. Crisp and cheesy. \\n\\nThe salmon dish was much smaller than we had anticipated although the sauce was quite tasty. But for the cost, it probably was not worthwhile. \\n\\nI personally got the hamachi crudo, which initially presents nicely but is quickly covered by a squid ink sauce. A bit on the salty, sour side - which is fine, except it is almost lathered in this sauce and it becomes hard to appreciate the fish itself. I felt this dish was lacking quite a bit. \\n\\nThe cocktails were decent and the vibes are nice. For the price of the meal, there are probably better options but if you want nice service, atmosphere, and close vicinity to Broadway, this is a reasonable stop. I think I would be ok with coming back here but wouldn't choose it if I had other options.\"]}, {'id': 'DGhWO1sUWydVeR5j5ZZaMw', 'name': 'La Grande Boucherie', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b9URGcuuhnLq7J-__pHIng/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://boucherieus.com', 'display_address': '145 W 53rd St', 'display_phone': '(212) 510-7714', 'rating': 4.4, 'reviews': ['Great ambiance, terrific food.

Located on 6 1/2 ave near times square/theatre district they've a lovely waiting and outdoor seating area that they've decked out for the holidays with lights and a huge christmas tree. They've also invested in heaters so that it's toasty warm even though it's all open and just outside on the street, it's still 20 degrees. \\n\\nCame here for a lovely meal on Christmas Day (there was a proposal and people surprise paying for each other's meals in the holiday spirit). The inside is even more beautiful than the outside and there seems to be more seating upstairs as well. \\n\\nSteak Frites - feel like they've put crack in the fries somehow. The steak was perfectly cooked. \\nLoup de Mer (sea bass) - lovely roasted potatoes in a herb butter sauce, a very light take on the sea bass. \\n\\nExcellent traditional French cuisine. Quick and attentive service. Free fresh bread with whipped butter. Highly recommend.\", 'Came here for the first time on christmas eve and was so disappointed, if you are looking for authentic french food dont come here. \\n\\nAdmit i came here after seeing instagram post about their christmas decorations and was looking for a festive spot but did not expect food to be soo bad.  Ordered the foie gras terrine but it did not even taste any duck taste at all, it tasted more like spam.  My coq au vin was not authentic either, instead of a tender braised fall off the bone chicken it was served like a pan roasted chicken breast with sauce on it, the chicken was dry too.  The two desserts we ordered were extremely bland and one note that we did not finish them.\\n\\nThe restaurant layout is very narrow and was super packed with tables close together even for manhattan standard, it felt super tight and uncomfortable. \\n\\nI gave them 2 stars purely because the steak was tasty.  I wont be back.', 'A little tourist trap feeling but a good experience. \\n\\nHad a dinner here and it was nice. \\n\\nHad the escargot which the waiter thought was amazing. It tasted good but not spectacular. Very generous portions with about 3 escargot per section.  Dip your bread in the sauce\\n\\nBone in striploin was cooked very well. Good sear outside and nice medium rare inside. They do this surprisingly well.', \"Went here with a few friends on a chilly Friday night. \\n\\nHere are my thoughts:\\n\\nAtmosphere: lively\\n\\nDecor: tastefully decorated for Xmas, regular decor is beautiful and elegant \\n\\nMusic: holiday music\\n\\nFood: complementary bread (was okay), octopus (was just okay), lobster bisque (it was nice but hardly found lobster inside it), oysters (had a nice brine to them, I enjoyed them), coq au vin (not the best that I've had but it was okay) \\n\\nDrinks: fraise crémouse (it was absolutely delicious! Would definitely recommend)\\n\\nService: friendly staff, but a bit slow and couldn't find someone at times \\n\\nGood for: date night, girl's night, family outing\\n\\nComments: there was long queue but we tried our luck and there was seating in the outdoor area. (Yay!). The floors in the outdoor area were heated and they had heating above the tables. They also had blankets if you wanted! \\n\\nGiving 3 stars because the food was not amazing  but it was still alright and we had to seek for a/our waiter at times.\", \"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely gorgeous dinner here. This spot is great for a date night or for a place to grab a nibble or drink. I'd describe it as corporate-fancy, with menu items that, while on the expensive side, are overall worth it. \\n\\nOur server was kind, knowledgeable, and very attentive. He was able to help me adjust  the menu items for my gluten allergy too.\\n\\nThe drinks were super strong and paired nicely with the food. I loved their twist on the French 75!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nSteak tartare (3.5/5) - this dish was fine but I wouldn't go back for it as it was a bit dry and tough. \\n\\nMesclun salad (4/5) - I really liked the dressing on this but the salad's main attraction was the goat cheese, which I sadly couldn't have. My boyfriend enjoyed the croquettes but thought the portioning and size of them didn't fully match the salad. \\n\\nCanard (5/5) - SO good. This was definitely my favorite of the night, the duck was tender and the sauce was a great silky consistency.\\n\\nBavette (4.5/5) - the steak was super tender but the sauce was a bit salty. The mashed potatoes cut the salt nicely though. \\n\\nIce cream (5/5) - this was the only dessert I could have but it was really really good. Absolutely recommend a spoonful of chocolate and vanilla together, if that's what you get.\\n\\nGreat experience overall; highly recommend going as a pre-theatre treat.\", \"Visiting NYC for Christmas, we were looking for a nice restaurant to dine at prior to going to Broadway. My daughter recommended La Grande Boucherie, and it was an excellent choice! The ambience of this place is amazing. The restaurant is huge with high ceilings decorated beautifully. It's like a little Paris in the heart of NY. \\n\\nOur dinners were outstanding! My wife and I both ordered off the Pre-Theatre Menu. I started with the French Onion soup with Bavette Diana as the main entree. The flatiron steak in Diane sauce was delicious! We both topped off the meal with Crème Brûlée. \\n\\nWe've been to many NYC restaurants prior to shows, but this one ranks amongst our favorites. From the setting, to the service, to the food, everything was first rate!\", \"The food here was really good and high quality. I got the muscles and beef tartare which both went super well with the bread provided. \\n\\nThere's indoor and outdoor seating but the outdoor is still semi inside with a roof over the outside area. The service here was great with everyone being very attentive. \\n\\nThis is a great spot to just hang out and grab a drink at.\", 'A beautiful garden-esque escape in the middle of the hustle and bustle of New York City, transporting you to a charming French oasis. \\n\\nYou cannot go wrong with staple French dishes like steak tartare and escargots.  \\n\\nSteak Tartare - A refined version of a quintessential steak tartare. You get a good bite from capers and cornichons to cut through the richness of the chopped beef tenderloin and the creaminess of the quail egg. This dish offers a satisfying blend of freshness and traditional French finesse.\\n\\nEscargots - Snails in a hot, bubbling bath of garlic-herb butter, but there was nothing noteworthy for me on this dish. Be careful when you eat the snails. It is scorching hot even when you let the dish cool.\\n\\nWagyu burger - This was topped with caramelized onion with a burger with a nice crust. This was a good burger, but nothing special or noteworthy. \\n\\nLes St. Jacques Roties - The scallops were perfectly cooked and the squash puree and lentils bought a nice warm, fall flavor profile.\\n\\nBoucherie Creme Brulee -  A delightful twist on the iconic French dessert that encompasses the diversity of the New York demographic. Beneath the perfectly caramelized, glassy sugar crust with black sesame is a creamy custard infused with the nutty, slightly earthy flavor of black sesame. \\n\\nProfiteroles - Light and airy choux pastry shells generously filled with vanilla ice cream, drizzled with warm, decadent chocolate sauce that cascades over the pastry, creating a tempting contrast of hot and cold. A perfect ending to a classic French meal\\n\\nService was impeccable and highly accommodating, enhancing the overall experience in this elegant setting. Not many restaurants have room with strollers, but they allowed us to sit with our new bundle of joy at our table during the calm lunch setting. They do have stroller parking available. Nikola went above and beyond. He explained the menu well and made great suggestions.', \"I was invited for a complimentary experience at La Grande Boucherie and loved every minute of my dinner. \\n\\nService was affable, warm, and courteous. We were not rushed to enjoy our experience, which was appreciated, especially as we witnessed every table around us fill up for dinner and stay busy throughout a rainy, cold Thursday night.\\n   \\nI am a drooler for tasteful ambiance & decor, and all three La Grande Boucherie locations deliver on this aspect. Gorgeous winter decor makes this particular restaurant a picture worthy holiday wonderland. Nothing like classy holiday lights all around the perimeter and a giant Christmas tree by the entrance to set the mood. We spent a good hour taking photos in all the possible spots in and outside of the restaurant. Visiting during any time outside the winter holiday season will prove as picturesque, as the restaurant is located in a beautiful, old space, combining classy, old school, white table cloths & wooden furniture vibes with chic, sleek modern decor.\\n\\nWe got the non-alcoholic PJ Breeze and the seasonally rotating non-alcoholic drink with cinnamon. Both were refreshing and satisfying. Great refreshment to balance our flavorful dinner.\\n\\nWe started with wagyu carpaccio, which was delicate and mild. The beef tartare that everyone around us was ordering looked spectacular, so next time, that's what we're getting.\\n\\nThe grilled octopus was tender and delicate in flavor.\\n\\nThe rack of lamb included brocollini and celeriac potato gratin [which I usually skip, as it tends to be too heavy for my liking, but this one was surprisingly light yet pleasantly satisfying] both of which were excellent. The meat was on the fatty side, so be aware that even though the portion is generous, if you're hungry for a good piece of meat, go with the steak.\\n\\nThe NY strip came with a few grilled baby peppers, and was an outstanding piece of meat. Recommend to anyone who's looking for a satisfying steak. I'd get this over the rack of lamb next time.\\n\\nChoosing dessert was a true challenge--everything looked so enticing, it was impossible to make up our mind! We got profiteroles and comme un paris brest. Both were delicious. Not too sweet, but perfectly satisfying. The choux pastry on both was freshly baked to perfection. Paris brest was like a high end spin on fancy peanut butter dessert--the bananas, peanuts and creme anglaise combined well for a satisfying, decadent bite. Will be sure to return to try all other enticing desserts on the menu. \\n\\nThe only thing we got that I would skip if I were to return would be the valrhona hot chocolate, as it didn't have flavor and tasted like warm milk.\", \"I'm so glad i came back!\\n\\nMy experience, the second time at this location was infinitely better. My company rented out the upstairs area for a holiday luncheon, and we were all greeted with champagne for a toast, as well as plenty of helpful and friendly staff showing us where we could sit, put our coats and purses, And always topping off our drinks, even without asking.\\n\\nOnce seated we were given plenty of bread and butter to munch on while we looked over the menu. We were given a prix fix menu, which had more options than expected, and was a tough call for me, but I ultimately decided to order the goat cheese croquette salad, the steak frites, and the Matcha/Yuzu tart. \\n\\nThe salad was interesting in a great way, with lots of flavors and textures from the apple slices, seeds, and piping hot, perfectly cooked croquettes. I did not have super high expectations for my steak, but it was delicious as well. My only note is I ordered it medium rare and it was quite cool, I wish there would've been in more crisp sear on the outside, but the fries were incredible and cooked to perfection. I found my dessert to be mild and definitely an option to get if you're someone that doesn't like things overly sweet.  \\n\\nThe restaurant was a lot more calm for lunch when we went midweek, which is a relief, but to be expected as the other time I died here was on Valentine's Day for dinner. It was really nice having our own upstairs area to get away from any foot traffic from outside parties, and the staff was definitely the highlight of this experience. \\n\\nWould recommend La Grande Boucherie for client lunches and dinners!\", \"WOW! Couldn't stop taking pictures of the food because everything looked so good!  The pictures truly speak for themselves but let's get into the details!\\n\\nLa Grande Boucherie is a short walk from the Rockefeller Center and the MOMA, making it a perfect lunch or dinner spot after checking out the gorgeous Rockeller tree (officially up on December 4th 2025), ice skating in the park, or enjoying the beautiful artwork at the museum. \\n\\nThe NYC beauty continues as soon as you step into La Grande. The decor is breathtaking and the European inspired layout creates a very class ambiance-- perfect spot for a date night or special occasion.\\n\\nI was invited for dinner and I honestly loved my experience. My friend and I started off our meal with the onion soup (was highly recommended by our waiter) and the waygu carpaccio. The onion soup was light and delicious! I was pleasantly surprised that the onion flavor wasn't too overpowering. The soup was a perfect start to the meal, although the portion was very large. My friend and I both tried the soup and we still couldn't finish it. I'm usually not a fan of raw meat but the waygu carpaccio was incredible! We were impressed by how soft and flavorful the meat was, truly melts in your mouth. The capers paired well with the meat too. The added aioli sauce made the dish a little too salty for us so we didn't use too much of the sauce. Overall 9/10 for the soup and 8/10 for the waygu.\\n\\nFor our main course we opted for the lamb and the fillet mignon. The lamb was so tasty with a perfect crisp over some of the fattier pieces. Overall the meat was soft and juicy even though I asked for it well done. The gratin was one of my favorite things I tried at the restaurant. It paired  nicely with the lamb but was also really good on its own! The filet mignon was also great. The black pepper on top added a perfect hint of spice and the mashed potatoes and gravy went well with it. Overall 9.5/10 for lamb and 9/10 for fillet mignon. \\n\\nWe also got mocktails which were refreshing and had an interesting blend of flavors so it didn't taste like just juice. I think there were only 2 mocktails to choose from. Would be nice to have a wider selection of mocktails but I suppose most people order the regular cocktails. \\n\\nWe couldn't resist the tempting dessert selection so we rounded out our meals with the creme brûlée and the cheesecake. Both were really good but I preferred the cheesecake. It was rich, smooth, and not too sweet. The mixed berry compote went so well with it and added a bit of tartness to cut the sugar.\\n\\nOverall a wonderful dinning experience with kind and friendly staff. Our waiter, Izzitten had a great sense of humor and was very warm!\", \"Great destination for savoring classic French plates in a stunning space. This place does holiday cheer right - it's decked out all over with garlands, lights, and a gigantic tree out front. Here, you're transported out of the Midtown chaos and into what feels like Paris. The restaurant is impressively large but manages to still feel cozy and inviting.\\n\\nThe filet mignon au poivre was cooked to perfection and crusted nicely on the outside. I liked the bavette diane even more as the sauce was lighter and sweeter, but both are classics done well. The onion soup was a delicious starter; see pictures for the cheese pull. Profiteroles were divine - chocolate, vanilla ice cream, and an airy pastry. The harvest moon cocktail is great for anyone wants something festive and light.\\n\\nStaff at the restaurant were welcoming and warm. At peak hours you may need to wait a while for your food to arrive, but it gives you more time to enjoy the ambience. Highly recommend this restaurant for treating yourself or others to a beautiful dining experience!\", \"Great meal in a grand setting at La Grande Boucherie!! What an amazing place - the architecture of the building - just wonderful! Really beautiful! You walk into what seems like an alleyway only to enter this long high ceiling atrium like space with a huge decorated Christmas tree and a piano next to it. Of course we took some photos by the tree. \\n\\nWe were looking on Yelp for a place to eat after going to the top of the rock followed by the ice rink and tree - and this was among the top restaurants that came up! So we walked over and they were able to seat us immediately no wait.\\n\\nIt's gorgeous inside just like the outside. Our server Sophie was especially friendly and great. She helped us decide between the lobster bisque and the French onion soup - and the lobster bisque was great - creamy savory with lobster pieces. Went great with the complimentary bread\\n\\nFor entree I ordered the salmon and hubs ordered the aged beef burger. Salmon was good, came with a red eskovitch sauce and veggies. Hubs enjoyed his burger too.\\n\\nWe were quite full so no dessert this time. \\n\\nOverall a really nice meal in a fabulous restaurant with great ambiance and excellent service!\", \"Just wow. La Grande Boucherie is absolutely stunning and I loved dining in this location! (Added plus that I went during the holidays and there were lights and a Christmas tree) I've gone to Boucherie Union Square, which I was not a fan of, but I'm glad I gave this spot a chance because it was wonderful and significantly better. \\n\\nFor appetizers, I would highly recommend the WAGYU CARPACCIO. I liked how the capers, horseradish and truffle aioli all mixed together. I was surprised that the aioli was as thick as it was. I'm used to carpaccio dishes that have a more liquid sauce, but this still tasted great and was a pleasant surprise! I also had the Escargots. I love the generous amount that they provide in this dish. However, I do wish that the butter, herb, and escargot itself blended together more seamlessly though.\\n\\nFor the main, I really loved the CUISSE DE CANARD CONFIT. The duck was extremely tender and had really good flavor. I also enjoyed all the vegetables that it came with. Highly recommend! The Filet Mignon was also perfectly medium rare, which was great. \\n\\nI also had their cocktails, which were solid. And for dessert, I shared the basque cheesecake with passionfruit sauce. Really enjoyed the sauce. \\n\\nWhat gives this place 5 stars is their excellent service, ambiance, and good vibes. The restaurant itself is really gorgeous and a fun spot to get dress up for. Would recommend for date nights, celebrations, or just a special treat!\", \"Walking into the LGB space, I was blown away at not only the size but it really is a beautiful setting.  Unfortunately, the food did not match up to the beautiful surroundings.  It was pre-holiday and the place was packed.  Our waiter matched the frenetic surroundings and was brusk-not in a cute French way but simply a mood of another table and another tip.  They have a typical brassiere/bistro  menu and tried a few items-french onion soup, caesar salad, and escargot.  Of all, the caesar salad was probably the best constructed and most tasty.  The escargot skewed on the rubbery side and the butter sauce lacked the garlic punch.  The French onion soup was average and at $22, wasn't worth it (even for NY pricing).  Yes, this is tucked away in a prime tourist spot but I felt it was more focused as a money grab rather than providing an excellent dining experience.\", 'a beautiful experience\\nI\\'ve been a few other boucherie locations but la grande boucherie is a different vibe as it sits in a building with tall ceilings conveying a sense of \"grandness\" \\nwe were seated in a corner with the view of the whole restaurant and the actions without being disturbed \\nfood quality is consistently good. I always love their bœuf bourguignon and canard confit. and expect a decent portion as well - they don\\'t cheat you on that. drinks and fries are a must \\nour server was very hospitable and made the evening even more lovely \\namazing choice for celebrations or a date night', \"This restaurant is a chain so I didn't have super high expectations but OH MY GOD was this one of the best meals I have had. Hands down the best French onion soup I've ever had, the escargot was divine, wagyu burger was juicy and full of flavor and the steak frites was a 10/10. \\n\\nService was fantastic! And the ambiance was super cute. \\n\\nI cannot wait to come back here!!!\", \"Was invited to have dinner here with a friend and we had an amazing time. Our waiter was attentive, described our dishes to us and answer any questions we have. The restaurant ambiance was nice and not too loud, we were still able to have conversation. Now the food...the food was delicious. For appetizer we ordered the French onion soup and POULPE GRILLÉ (grilled octopus). We devoured our apps. The soup was flavorful with a good amount of cheese on top. The Octopus dish was tasty and  cooked perfectly. For our main dish I had the Cuisse De Canard Confit (duck leg) and my friend had the Boeuf Bourguignon (braised beef). These dishes came out fresh and hot, which was perfect. The duck leg was cooked nicely with lots of flavor and it fell off the bones. The braised beef was also very flavorful and melted in your mouth. The mash and veggies that went along with the dishes were also cooked perfectly. We were pretty full after but there's always room for dessert! I had the traditional crème brûlée and my friend had the roasted black sesame crème brûlée. The black sesame crème brûlée had a delicious bold roasted sesame flavor. Both desserts were delicious and of course we finished them! Overall, we had great service, delicious food and good company. Will definitely come back and try the other dishes!\", \"We loved everything about this experience here: Ozzy was our server and he not only had the best recommendations for our meal, but was incredibly attentive and took incredible care of us. The atmosphere of the restaurant is incredibly enchanting, elevated and transports you to France. My husband and I had the best birthday meal here and can't wait to come back the next time we are in town. My beef bourguignon was the best I have ever had- loaded with bursting flavors and the moules dijonaisse also had complexity and was superb. My husband ordered the octopus and found it to be tender and also perfectly seasoned. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening- so appreciative to the staff for making the night memorable.\", \"As a disclosure, my husband and I are big fans of all the Boucherie restaurants. They have perfected the art of French Brasserie meals in NY and the service is always exceptional in all of their locations. My husband likes to joke that that is probably the least French thing about these establishments. \\n\\nOur latest visit was on par with our expectations. Our waiter Ozzy was phenomenal and all his recommendations hit the mark. For starters he recommended the escargot and moules frites. The escargot sauce was delish and as I remember. The last time I visited this restaurant was during the pandemic and happy to report that the quality of the food has even gotten better. The sauce was perfection and was savored with bread. What I love about this prep is that I didn't have to work so hard extricating the meat from the shell as most other places do + each portion had 2 snails! The mussels were delightful and good sized. And of course the sauce was also on point.\\n\\nFor the mains I resorted to the lamb which was tender and my husband opted for filet mignon.  No complaints whatsoever.\\n\\nThe desserts were also great and I had delightfully (like a child) enjoyed the profiteroles (careful with brain freeze moments) and the chocolate cake with dashes of gold flakes. Talk about a sinfully delish end to the meal.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend a visit considering how special the space is. It's very reminiscent of European arcades, tucked away in an unassuming section of midtown. The decor this time of the year is super festive and a great stop before or after meandering Rockefeller. I say do that after to maximize digesting the feast you'll have. \\n\\nBtw if you're a native New Yorker, fear not that it's just a tourist spot. It isn't. It does attract pre theater crowd but definitely could over hear lots of locals who I assume work in the area. Would reckon at lunch time this is a fun biz lunch spot compared to traditional steakhouses. Certainly more vibey.\", \"My wife and I had a wonderful lunch at La Grande Boucherie midtown.  The restaurant is in a spacious indoor space and we really liked the décor and ambience, bistro-style with high ceilings. There is an upstairs area overlooking the main dining floor and a small mezzanine with a couple of tables.  I think the big space helps keep the noise level down so you can actually have a conversation, unlike a lot of other places.  They also have a $39 prix fixe lunch menu on weekdays so this would be a good spot for business lunch.\\n\\nWe started with a glass of Cremant de Loire, which we were happy to find because we don't often see French sparkling wine on menus.  Then we shared three appetizers:  escargots, prosciutto de canard and mesclun salad with goat cheese croquettes.  Each dish was delicious, fresh and well-prepared.  The prosciutto de canard and the mesclun salad, in particular, were unique takes that you won't find elsewhere.\\n\\nFor the main course, we shared the prime steak frites, which was cooked nicely to our requested medium rare temperature.  We like bistro steak because it's tasty but not humongous like steakhouses, and this one fit the bill.  \\n\\nFor dessert, we tried both the classic crème brulee and black sesame crème brulee to compare.  The traditional version is a classic, with a very thin caramelized crust, while the black one was a unique twist that we enjoyed.  We enjoyed both a lot and left completely stuffed.  \\n\\nThere is also a beautiful, long bar where you can drink and eat if you are a small group.  We've also been to Boucherie Union Square and that was also excellent.  We would definitely return.\", 'My wife and I decided to dine here for our date night and truly had a wonderful time. Service was excellent and everyone not only our server was very helpful and attentive. Food was amazing but not overly pricey. We came around the holidays and everything was nicely decorated from floor to ceiling including the atrium. It is the perfect spot for a date night. \\n\\nLooking forward to coming back here and bringing the kids. \\n\\nWe ordered the tomahawk steak, French onion and profiteroles.', \"Welcome to a little slice of Paris nestled in the heart of NYC. The minute you are welcomed into the building, you will find numerous plants lined up to create an atrium oasis alongside the grand and exquisite decor. Once we checked in with the host, we were led to a table in the dining room. I have to say that it got a bit too warm in there though.\\n\\nTo start, I had the La Vie En Rose ($22) while the boyfriend had the Boucherie Old Fashioned ($22). I liked how the lychee and floral notes really shined in my cocktail, which was refreshing. We also got complimentary bread that was paired with the fluffiest salted butter. I shouldn't have finished all the bread, but that butter was so good.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the small Prime Steak Tartare ($28) and Prosciutto ($14). The steak tartare was delicious and they gave a good amount to top on a toasted crostini. Also nice and refreshing to have a side salad as well, so you get the best of both worlds. For the main entree, I had the Steak Frites ($54) while he had the Entrecôte Grille ($62). The steaks were cooked perfectly tender, but it was the garlic butter and bordelaise sauce that really took the steaks to the next level. Of course the fries were nice and crispy too. To be honest, I was super full by this point, but couldn't say no to a dessert. We ordered the Boucherie Creme Brulee ($16), which was a black sesame flavor. I was quite intrigued to see this Asian flavor, but it was a bit too overwhelming unfortunately. I'd probably just stick to the regular creme brulee in the future.\\n\\nWith all that said, this is one of the most grand and gorgeous restaurants I've come across in NYC with the high ceilings to the elegant decor. It's the perfect place for a special occasion or catching a pre-theatre meal. All the food and drinks were done well and a great way to treat yourself to a fancy meal.\", \"first all, OZZY was the BEST server I've ever had at any restaurant. he was super attentive the moment we sat. he gave amazing recommendations. I enjoyed every second of the time dining here. definitely on the pricer end, but so worth it. every single dish was amazing. the interior had me speechless. you almost forget that you're in NYC. I can't wait to come back!\", 'Came by for dinner and sat at the bar. Found the temperature to be a little stuffy and humid interestingly, even though it was nice and breezy out. Big space with lots of outdoor and indoor seating. \\n\\nI ordered the Steak Tartare and the scallops. Both had a nice presentation. The tartare was good but the potato chips were stale, which was pretty disappointing. The scallops were cooked well, but the dish was a little on the sweeter side and I think I would have preferred more savory.\\n\\nNice place, good service, but also pricey.', \"This was my second time trying la grande boucherie, but my first time at the nyc location. The first thing that stood out to me was the staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming- special shout-out to Chris! They have both inside and outside seating and will give you blankets if it's cold outside. The interior is very pretty and large- it had both a downstairs and upstairs section. \\n\\nTo start, I ordered the phoenix drink. I loved it! It was the perfect level of sweetness and it was strong. For appetizers, I ordered the salad. The goat cheese croquettes especially stood out to me, the outside was perfectly crispy with still maintaining the goat cheese! For my main, I ordered the lamb cooked well done. I thought it was great. The highlight of the night for me were the profiteroles. I would definitely come back just to order those. The chocolate and vanilla ice cream was perfect and melted in your mouth! \\n\\nLa grande boucherie continues to impress me for food, service, and ambiance. They were setting up a Christmas tree when I left and mentioned that it would be a great spot to take pictures and stories by during the winter. Definitely a great spot for a nice dinner or night out.\", \"Thanks to the team at La Grande Boucherie for inviting me to dine; I had a great experience! The decor in the restaurant is beautiful and well thought out, and the vibe of the restaurant is of a classic NYC dining experience. This was one of the largest restaurants I've been to in the city, and I was impressed with how well the staff were able to accommodate and attend to so many customers. \\n\\nFor the food, we tried \\n- Lobster Bisque: My favorite dish of the night! The soup was flavorful and creamy without being too rich, and the lobster was tender.\\n- Escargot: I feel like this is a must get at French restaurants, but I thought it was alright. There was a lot of butter and salt, but I didn't feel like there was a ton of other flavor.\\n- Steak Frites: Very solid steak. The steak was juicy and I thought the garlic (?) butter added a nice flavor. I also really liked the fries; they had the perfect texture. \\n- Seared Scallops: Scallops were super juicy and had the perfect sear. I was also a fan of the squash puree, which was creamy and sweet.\\n- Pistachio Ice Cream: Texture was creamy and on the sweeter side. Solid but not standout as far as ice cream goes, mostly just ordered this because we were feeling ice cream.\\n- Matcha Yuzu Finger Tart: I really enjoyed this dessert; not only did it look pretty, but the yuzu filling was delicious and not too sweet!\\n\\nOverall, good food with a wonderful ambiance!\", 'Great food, great service, great drinks! We loved the atmosphere! They have the most beautiful Christmas decor,  also! Definitely a must try!', \"My recent dining experience at La Grande Boucherie was awesome!! Friendly & attentive service set the tone for the meal, Our waitress Sanja was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive, making thoughtful recommendations and ensuring that everything was perfect throughout the evening.\\n\\nWe started with the Wagyu truffle carpaccio, a delicious and light dish that set the bar high. The grilled octopus followed and had a nice slight char flavor and was insanely tender!\\n\\nFor our main course, we ordered the ribeye and the steak frites, both of which were cooked perfectly medium rare. Golden crispy fries for the perfect French classic.\\n\\nTo end the meal, we enjoyed the profiteroles stuffed with rich vanilla ice cream and drizzled with a warm, decadent chocolate sauce. The combination was heavenly, and a perfect conclusion to great dinner\\n\\nLa Grande Boucherie has truly mastered the art of French cuisine, with an elegant yet relaxed atmosphere and attentive service that makes you feel welcomed and valued. I can't wait to return and explore more of the menu.\", 'A pretty good find in Time Square where the space is very nice and hidden enough with a really nice atmosphere. We came here for brunch and they had standard breakfast but what stood out to me was their Oeufs Meurette (Red Wine Poached Eggs). Never heard of this dish before and was pleasantly surprised. A savory and hearty dish with a slight kiss of red wine that is decadent and surprisingly delish for brunch. Would recommend for foodies out there. Service is pretty standard and definitely gets busier in the evenings.', \"Agh! It's so tough to give two stars because the food was truly amazing but this was maybe the worst service I've had. \\nHere's the good: \\n- Yes, it's amazing for Christmas, it's so beautiful \\n- The food is amazing. Yes to the French Onion Soup. Yes to the Steak Frites \\n\\nHere's the bad: \\n- the service is so BAD. like you have to be willing to wait for a while (2+ hours) do not go here if you have to run to a show after, you will NOT make it \\n\\n\\nWould I give them another chance, yes! \\nIt's the holidays, it's just a tough time and this restaurant is located in such a touristy part of New York. But with that being said, restaurants need to plan and account for this fact, if I know that, you DEFINITELY know that. \\nOur server was slammed but with that being said he needed to ask for help.\", \"Elevated French classics and exceptional service make this restaurant a gem in Midtown, where I haven't had the best luck in finding good restaurants.\\n\\nMy friend and I came here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was huge, but there were diners at almost every table. Despite its size, the restaurant is cozy and homey. We sat on the balcony where we had a great view of the first floor of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe shared the following dishes:\\n\\nLes Escargots (snails): a classic for a reason! All the usual characters (shallots, lemon, parsley, garlic butter) made an appearance. The Pernod in the dish was detectable but not distracting. \\n\\nLa Salade de Betteraves (beet salad): simple and delicious! We really liked the roquefort cream and thought it complemented the beets really well.\\n\\nCuisse de Canard Confit (duck confit): very rich, but comforting and the perfect autumn or winter dish. The duck leg was served with seasonal vegetables and parsnip purée. We liked sharing this but thought it would be a bit heavy for one person.\\n\\nLes St Jacques Rôties (scallops): the scallops were seared and served with squash purée and lentils. I have never tried this combination before, and while unexpected, it was my favorite dish of the evening!\\n\\nCrème brûlée: could you ever go wrong with crème brûlée? It was very light as far as crème brûlées go. This was my favorite dessert between the two that we tried.\\n\\nParis-Brest: we really liked the flavors of this dish. The peanut crème légère and banana crème anglaise were fun ventures from the traditional components of this dish and complemented each other very well.\\n\\nBesides the food, what made this meal really special was the service. Our waitress was attentive, and perhaps more importantly, genuinely warm and made us feel welcomed and at home. \\n\\nOverall, I would really recommend coming here. I think it would be a perfect location to celebrate a special occasion or to go on a date night.\", \"I was so happy when I realized this place was down the block from our hotel! We came here for a late lunch/ happy hour and decided to sit at the bar. I have to start by saying, this place just looks magical! It feels magical as well once you are here! Being a native NYer, I did not really go into the city to just roam around as an adult. There was not much time between school, work, and travel time from Queens. It was nice this trip to visit, stay in the city for the first time, and browse new restaurants to try close to the hotel.\\n\\nThe bar was almost empty so we were greeted immediately. Hubs ordered an Old Fashioned and I ordered the happy hour drink special, which I was told was Tequila based. We were hungry but had dinner plans for Italian and didn't want to eat too much. After browsing the menu, we decided on the Soupe A L'Oignon and Pomme Frites. \\n\\nWhile we waited, I decided to use the restroom. OMG it was so unique! I never take my phone to the bathroom but decided to go back and grab my purse just so I can take pictures! I thought it was stunning! The stalls were actual rooms! It was also clean and stocked. Our food arrived by the time I returned to my seat.\\n\\nThe soup was amazing of course! We have been to plenty of places where the Onion soup was very salty or bland in flavor. This one was just perfect! The frites were okay. Not the worst but not the best I have had. We ordered a second round of drinks and decided to close out after. The restaurant and bar filled up quickly within the last 30 minutes we were there. I highly recommend this place and I hope to dine here again on my next visit back home.\", 'Dressed for the holidays, the restaurant provided us with great atmosphere and vibrancy. We got reservations ahead of time, so we made the line, which took no more than 5 min. and got seated right away. Our seats were tucked in the back, nice for conversation. My partner and I ordered ourselves espresso martinis 8/10, had prime steak frites 8/10, along with smoked Gouda macaroni gratin 7/10, which were both portioned nicely and ended the night with a basque cheesecake to share, to which the sever insisted it paired well with the berry coulis 7.5/10, and I agreed -- it was tastier with and not overly sweet. We got lucky with our server being Namik. He was attentive, and charming which made the overall experience a good one.', \"Great French restaurant in midtown Manhattan. We ordered 4 dishes to share and everything was good.\\n\\n- Onion soup: 10/10 (great onion soup. Very hearty and balanced.)\\n- Lamb chop: 10/10 (fantastic lamb chops that were cooked very well)\\n- Filet mignon: 9/10 (pretty good steak. Liked the mashed potatoes it came with.)\\n- Mixed green salad with goat cheese: 10/10 (good salad with different textures and flavors. Loved the goat cheese croquette.)\\n\\nVibes were good but on the noisier side. Service though was very very very slow-- it wasn't even particularly that busy that night.\", \"Food: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Experience: 4.5/5\\n\\nI had a really great time dining at this beautiful restaurant in the theater district. The decor and architecture are stunning. My party of two was able to get seated immediately with our reservation; we were offered a more casual space or dining room. We got complimentary (warm) bread with whipped butter (very yummy)\\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the prime steak tartare and the mousse de foie gras. The tartare was not too heavy nor overpowering in flavor. The foie gras was creamy and paired really well with the cherries, which was unexpected for me. I enjoyed eating these two with well-toasted crostini.\\n\\nFor mains, we ordered the filet mignon and the cotelettes d'agneau (lamb). The portions were very generous. The filet mignon was tender and cooked very nicely. The lamb was a bit on the dry side, but the flavor was really great - the lamb really shone through and bits were nicely crispy. I liked that the lamb was served with rapini and a gratin. Presentation for both dishes was beautiful.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the basque cheesecake with berry coulis and the boucherie creme brulee. Neither dessert was overly sweet. The creme brulee was very creamy and encrusted with black sesame seeds, which I really enjoyed  the flavor of. The cheesecake was also creamy but a little heavier. I'm not too sure I enjoyed the coulis on it that much as it tasted like liquid jam; I would've preferred it to be a bit more tart.\\n\\nOverall, I had a great experience, and I would come back.\", \"Such a lovely lunch hang. Amazing service from our kind, exceedingly professional and attentive server Sophia. What a gem. Employee of the decade. We were seated promptly upon arrival at a great table upstairs overlooking the main dining area. Festive yet quiet enough up there we could have a good chat. We didn't order much, we weren't starving. The onion soup was divine, perfectly done. Amazing cheese pull - haha. Beautiful restaurant, glad I finally was able to experience. It's really a charming escape. Will definitely be going back soon.\", \"La Grande Boucherie is an absolute gem! We visited with family from overseas, and it was a memorable dining experience. I ordered the filet mignon, which was perfectly cooked, incredibly tender, and full of flavor. It was served alongside a fresh salad with a dressing that was absolutely delightful.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had the crème brûlée, and it was heavenly. The caramelized top was perfectly crisp, and the fresh fruit added a refreshing touch that elevated the dish to the next level.\\n\\nThe ambiance was charming, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. Overall, it was a fantastic meal, and I can't recommend La Grande Boucherie enough for a special occasion or just a great night out!\", \"Yes!!!\\n\\nFinally, a Christmastime restaurant in NYC that gives vibes, great food, and knowledgeable service all while serving up beautiful decor. This is a must try if you are looking for a place to try. I got the French onion soup which was soooooo good, perfect for a cold NYC night. My dinner companion got the oysters which they raved about, along with a Hennessy Sidecar drink. Lastly, I did get the steak frites- SO GLAD I did it. I was impressed by how delicious that steak was and the fries were cooked to perfection. I topped it off with a Bernaise sauce and the whole thing was devoured. \\nI highly recommend this place- I don't think you will be disappointed.\", 'Loved! Went for brunch and our group of 4 was very happy! Excellent service, gorgeous quiet ambiance, and the food was truly outstanding. \\n\\nHighly recommend everything we ordered!\\n\\nEscargot - so tender! Beautiful garlic herb butter sauce. \\n\\nSteak tartare - so flavorful! \\n\\nSmoked salmon eggs Benedict. Roasted yellow potatoes it came with were amazing. \\n\\nbasque style cheesecake (drier denser cheesecake style) with warm passion fruit caramel sauce / to die for!\\n\\nBlack sesame Creme brûlée - omg heaven!', \"This location is always beautiful, but December specifically is a magical time to visit La Grande Boucherie's 53rd street location. The beautiful high ceilings and decor throughout the restaurant are timeless, and when you add a giant Christmas tree to the lobby area, it becomes a must. Came here on a Tuesday night with a 7 PM reservation, and while there was a line to check in, it moved very quickly and everyone was seated very quickly. I absolutely adored their apple mocktail, and just generally loved appreciate they have multiple on menu non-alcoholic options (alongside and exhaustive wine menu for the drinkers). To start we had a large order of the steak tartar which was definitely a large serving for just 2 people and is probably more suitable for 3 or even 4 - but we finished every bite because it's just that delicious. Personally I don't prefer crispy bread with my tartar though, so instead of using the toasted baguette I enjoyed it with the fresh baguette that was offered when we sat at our table. We also had the escargot, which for me is a must at any French dining experience. For dinner I had the boef bourguignon, which again is a must for me when at a classic French spot. It was a generous portion that was fantastically seasoned, with veggies that had the perfect amount of bite, and honestly rivaled bourguignons I've had in France. My partner was similarly thrilled with his order of steak frites. The quality of the meat was really outstanding, and it was cooked perfectly to order. For dessert, we enjoyed the Basque cheesecake as well as the mini Madeleine's, although it was very hard to pick from the extensive pastry menu. Both were delicious, with the cheesecake definitely being a favorite (we got the mixed berry sauce but I'd be tempted to try the chocolate next time).\\n\\nOverall, this experience was everything I could have wanted in a high-end French restaurant, and is even a place I would consider to come sit at the bar just to enjoy a cocktail or mocktail. As always, I recommend making a reservation, but with such a large and well staffed reservation it shouldn't be too tricky to get one. Generally, this would be a great spot for everything from a fancy date night to a client dinner (considering its location I would even stop by here for a preshow dinner!).\", \"Beautiful French restaurant! The decor inside and outside (on 6.5 Street) is really spectacular. We came here for my wife's birthday and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.\\n\\nWe started with the Watermelon Salad. It was a refreshing way to start our meal. For entree, I had the Prime Steak Frites. It was a NY strip steak topped with butter and French fries on the side. Both the steak and the fries were delicious. For dessert, we had the Creme Brulee and the Profiteroles. It was my first time trying Profiteroles. I thought it was good, but it was very, very sweet due to all the chocolate, ice-cream, Chantilly, and then a bit more ice-cream.\\n\\nLa Grande Boucherie is a nice restaurant to celebrate that special occasion.\", 'To start off, what a beautiful restaurant! My friend and I were seated on the second floor, overlooking the first floor and that was a sight! The bar is gorgeous too. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Checked on us just enough so kudos to them! \\n\\nMy drink for the night was the Côte d\\'Azur Spritz. If you like an aperol spritz you\\'ll love this too. A little bitter, sweet and light. Delicious! My friend started with the Boucherie Sazerac and I kid you not, kept saying \"this is so good\" every other sip. \\n\\nWith your order, you get a complimentary bread basket. I love when restaurants do this and this was good. We got a Caesar salad and the poulpe grille (grilled octopus). My first time having octopus in this form, I really enjoyed the potatoes and the sauce (?) it came with. Was personally indifferent to the octopus itself. My friend, who\\'s a BIG lover of octopus, really enjoyed this dish. He said the cook on it was amazing, comparable to a tender steak which I definitely admire because octopus is really easy to get chewy. He did say the end of it was crispy which was wonderful and wished it was that way throughout. The Caesar salad was the perfect breath of freshness and I gobbled it right up! \\n\\nFor our entrees, I got the cuisse de canard confit (duck leg) with a side of fries. I love the fries here, sooooo good. I guess it\\'s in the name, the French know how to make really good fries. I liked the duck as well, the skin was crispy which I loved, but do have to say parts of the leg meat were a little too overcooked/dry. My friend got Les st Jacques roties (scallops) with a side of the Mac and cheese. He really enjoyed the scallops. We were divided on the Mac and cheese. He wished the cheese used was sharper and that it was less liquidy. I personally didn\\'t mind it (but I didn\\'t grow up with Mac and cheese so I\\'m not a connoisseur). If you\\'re going to have it, I\\'d likely recommend it with something rich. \\n\\nWe ended our meal with the yuzu/matcha tart and I really loved that. Again, we were a little divided; my friend thought the crust was a little too dry, whereas I appreciated the textural difference from the filling. \\n\\nAll in all, an absolutely wonderful experience and I can\\'t wait to return!', \"I'm a coffee, eggs and sweets lover so while in busy NYC I suggested La Grande Boucherie for the Parisian cafe brunch experience.  I enjoyed my food, coffee, service and the upbeat atmosphere. I sat inside, but it's partially open to an open air walkway.  On a winter day, you may want to have on cozy layers to stay warm.  I was one of a party of two, so seating wasn't a huge issue but this appears to be a destination for big parties which will impact wait times.\", 'This La Grande Boucherie is the largest of the three that I have been to. But like their other two locations it has an open lush feel and great service.\\n\\nI was here for a work event and we were in a sectioned off area by the stairs that felt private but not tucked away in some obscure location.\\n\\nWe had a prix fixe menu to choose from and selected \\nPrime steak frites and the mussels to start.\\n\\nFood was fantastic (I tried a bite of someones salmon and it was a perfect med) \\n\\nIt was great for a group lunch with a good pacing of meals and attentive service', \"La Grande Boucherie is a solid, but not remarkable, French restaurant offering good, but not amazing, food, great service, and a classy upscale atmosphere at an upscale price. As the name suggests, La Boucherie sells itself on its meats, offering a wide variety of steaks prepared in French tradition.\\n\\nOur family came here on a Thursday evening, reservation in hand made weeks prior. Our server was friendly, professional, and quickly forgave us for a broken saucer from the clumsy hands of the youngest in our party.\\n\\nAfter a tasty baguette with butter I ordered the Prime Steak Frites ($54) and the spouse the filet du boeuf ($63). My steak was rather thin for a NY strip, returned as a medium rather than medium rare, but had a good sear and the pairing fries were excellent. Good, but not phenomenal.\\n\\nThe restaurant was upscale, open, airy, clean, and impeccably dressed for the holidays. I won't be the first reviewer to tell you that La Grande Boucherie is timelessly trendy - couples and families dressed to the nines in their holiday best filled the place, giving a careless, classy vibe.\\n\\nPrices are high, but expectedly so for a restaurant of this type in this part of Manhattan. While generally expensive, as most things are this side of town, the prices weren't egregious. Don't expect the food quality to match the price tag, however. You're paying for classy vibes, good service, and the atmosphere at La Boucherie. \\n\\nChic vibes, great service, and good food at an upscale price, La Grande Boucherie is a solid entry into the Manhattan French scene, excellent for a date who doesn't mind forking over a few extra francs for a fancy function.\\n\\nFood: 4/5\\nService: 4.5/5\\nAmbiance: 4.5/5\\nValue: 4/5\"]}, {'id': 'hLXe3RVRK39VUSPdvBjFEA', 'name': 'Kalye-Broome', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lIwFGGvKoBW9yaNGdH7lVA/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://kalye.com', 'display_address': '251 Broome St', 'display_phone': '(646) 422-7267', 'rating': 4.5, 'reviews': [\"This place has been on my bookmarked Filipino spots and it bangs.

I got four items: lychee juice, mango salad, wings, and the halo halo. \\n\\nThe lychee juice was fine; it's just lychee juice but not too sweet. \\n\\nThe mango salad is bland. It is just chopped mango, tomato, cucumber. I don't know if they just forgot the seasoning on mine, but i had to ask for salt because it felt like they just chopped it and put it on the plate. \\n\\nThe wings had a tasty seasoning, still light-handed, but they were very dry and tough. They were pretty large so sure that had something to do with it. \\n\\nThe halo halo was the only saving grace. The ube ice cream they have is tasty, and salted like a salted caramel.\", 'I loved this little corner in the busy new york. It felt so homy and calming in the middle of a busy city. I LOVED the dessert from this place. And I will be going back with a big group to try their other big food platters!', \"As a pinay, I was excited to try Kalye! Solid lil Filipino restaurant with a few things I didn't care for...\\n\\nI made ressies for 6 people a month in advance for a Saturday night since I would be visiting NY and knew this place was popular. As well as tiny. So I recommend making a res since this place only has 5 tables inside but there are some tables outside too. \\n\\nWe were greeted when we walked in and I was surprised to see only one waitress working on this busy Saturday night. Place is cute. Every table was occupied except ours that was ready for us. The menu is pretty meat heavy. I'm not a vegetarian but not a good place to take a vegetarian, which unfortunately was one of my friends as she only had an appie and side to choose from. No entrees...\\n\\nEsaladong talong- If you like tangy and vinegar-y food you'll like this. I prefer my eggplant savory but this was good. We ate it with a small plate of the inasal rice. The flavor was good just wish there was more of a garlic flavor but the rice tasted like day old....\\n\\nPork belly kare kare - the sauce is delicious. Don't forget to ask for the bagoong. We Filipinos know kare kare is supposed to be with oxtail not pork belly so a lil disappointed with that. But a couple of the pork belly pieces were tough and too hard to bite into. Meh. Oh and not a fan of paying $4 for a small plate of white rice! The $32 kare kare does not come with rice and ya'll know you need to eat this dish with rice. Overall I didn't think this dish was worth the price but as my local friends said, that's NY prices for ya...\\n\\nMy vegetarian friend asked for the veggie lumpia. The waitress apologized and said they aren't making those anymore. She explained they are moving to a new bigger location soon so they stopped making a few items on the menu. So my friend asked for the mushroom sisig. Then the waitress comes back and says they are out of it. But they do have some vegetarian lumpia my friend can have instead. So odd but my friend said the lumpia was good...went to get pizza somewhere after bc she was still hungry. Lols\", \"Stopped by Kalye, a Filipino spot in the Lower East Side, because I really wanted to try their Club 85, but you need a party of three or more, and I was just with one other person. Oh well, maybe next time! The staff were super nice though--really friendly and attentive. The vibe is chill and relaxed, perfect for a low-key hangout.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the pork barbecue skewers, mango salad, and crispy lumpia (spring rolls). I was excited for the mango salad, but it was a huge letdown. The mango wasn't ripe, so it didn't have any flavor. The tomatoes and cucumbers didn't have much seasoning either. There was some black pepper on top, but it didn't help much--it was pretty bland overall.\\n\\nThe crispy lumpia looked cool, stacked up like little building blocks, and came with fish sauce. But when I tried the lumpia with the fish sauce, it was way too salty. When I ate it on its own, it didn't have much flavor, but dipping it in sweet chili sauce made a huge difference. With the sweet chili sauce, it was perfect!\\n\\nThe pork barbecue skewers were good, though. They came with rice and four pretty big skewers. Some of the meat was a little burnt, so I had to pick off those bits, and the first piece I had was fat, which was tough to chew. But after that, the rest was all meat, and it was delicious! The barbecue sauce was on point--I just wish the meat wasn't overcooked in spots.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back when I have a bigger group so I can finally try that Club 85!\", '5/5 wow the food here is great. The first time i tried to come by for lunch and the wait was over 30 minutes and I ended up leaving because I was so hungry. The next time I came I decided to join the waitlist ahead of time. The restaurant itself is pretty small but the food is totally worth it. \\n\\nI had the cripsy lumpia, ube longganisa sliders, and the pork sisig. All of it was soooo good. The ube longganisa sliders were so unique and worth a try. I also got the halo halo at the end which was the best way to end the meal. \\n\\nI hope that next time I will be able to try their club 85 because I saw many other tables getting it', \"I'm always down with trying a Filipino restaurant, and this was the case during our recent trip to NYC. Their unique take on the Ube sliders was really interesting. The longganisa (pork sausage) based protein hit the right spot for me. However, I'd have to state that their Pork Sisig was a just ...meh, but the outstanding service from the staff made up for it. \\nThe place in on the small side, so it can get cozy...and they have an street side area that can accommodate 3-4 more tables. Overall, I'd recommend it and wouldn't mind going back.\", \"Kayle was Nanette Z's choice for her birthday lunch party. Kayle is a small restaurant and our party of 16 basically took the whole place on two long tables and stools.\\n\\nThe ambiance is casual with lots of contemporary street art sprayed on the walls. Don't miss the restroom walls too, with cool LGBT-focused artwork.\\n\\nThe Filipino food is awesome! Course after course kept coming out. The Crispy Lumpia were pretty good, but the Inasal Wings were really tangy and tasty. Yum! Pork Sisig was also delicious.\\n\\nMy favorite was the Pork Lechon, with to-die-for crispy pork skin. Phenomenal! The Pork Adobo Ribs were indeed fall-off-the-bones and we couldn't get enough. Mango salad at the end was refreshing and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff were awesome and kept the pace. We had a great time, and they allowed us to bring our own wine bottles for $10 corkage. Kayle is definitely worth a stop on your casual gastronomic journey through NYC.\", \"They need a bigger space as this spot became super popular, which luckily it looks like that is in the works. I feel like Filipino restaurants are a rare cuisine to come by in NYC, so it is welcoming to see them claim a spot in LES.\\n\\nThe menu is very pork heavy, which would be my complaint, but I made the best of it as it's highly recommended. It was hard to have multiple items with the amount of table space we had, which was tiny. Didn't help that there was table decor taking up space.\\n\\nI have never seen anyone offer Nanjing Black Beer's Master Gao ($10) so I had to get this. If you're a dark beer person, this is for you.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we started off with the Ube Longganisa Sliders ($12.50). You get two sliders so my buddy and I each had one. They definitely make good snacks if you're not looking for a full dinner.\\n\\nFor entrees, we ordered the Pork Lechon ($22), which is a 4 hour loaded pork belly over rice with crispy pork rind. Definitely love that crispy fried pork skin. It was for sure pork galore. If that wasn't enough pork, we also ordered their Pork Sisig ($20), which is a Filipino staple. You simply cannot go wrong with this dish.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the Ube Pao ($10), which is pretty unique. These are in the form of steamed buns made from ube filled with coconut cream. Surprisingly not too sweet.\", \"Wanted to love this place but it left me disappointed. Two of the things I wanted were out. I realize they were closed the next day but to be out TWO things just didn't sit well with me. Ended up getting the Inasal Wings and the Inasal Rice. I was skeptical when I saw it was only 6 wings but it's 6 whole wings cut up (minus the flap, of course) so that was a happy surprise! The flavor was all there. VERY good BUT I think they could've been cooked a little longer. I like my chicken to fall off the bone. The Inasal Rice was delicious but I half expected a more garlicky flavor. Service was great! Our server was super friendly and kind. I loved his spirit. The place is tiny so we were lucky to be able to get a table albeit a high top. Considering it's NYC, the prices were decent.\", \"Kalye on Broome Street has been touted as the best Filipino food in NYC, and while I wouldn't go that far, it's certainly worth a visit. Their menu, while slim, offers some delicious options that highlight the flavors of Filipino cuisine. \\n\\n**What I Loved:**\\n\\n* **Lumpia Shanghai:** These crispy spring rolls are a must-try. \\n* **Sisig:** While I'm not typically a fan of the traditional recipe with pig ears and cheeks, Kalye's pork-based version is unique and flavorful. \\n* **Kare Kare:** This oxtail stew with shrimp paste is a classic Filipino dish, and Kalye's rendition is rich and satisfying. (Kalye's version is with pork). \\n\\n**What Could Be Better:**\\n\\n* **Menu Selection:** The menu is quite limited, which might be disappointing for those seeking a wider range of Filipino dishes. \\n* **Spice Level:** The pork Sisig was quite spicy, which might not be ideal for everyone.\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nKalye offers a taste of Filipino cuisine in a charming setting. While it may not be the absolute best in NYC, it's a solid choice for a casual meal with friends. The food is good, the atmosphere is lively, and the music sets a pleasant vibe. If you're looking for a taste of the Philippines, Kalye is worth checking out, but don't expect a full-fledged Filipino feast.\\n\\nThe service is also friendly and welcoming.\", 'Made a reservation on yelp for a Friday night dinner. Super easy. We got the club 85 platter and it was definitely enough for 4. Meat heavy meal, so not many options for pescatarians (one person in our party had to get a separate dish). You have the option to add on shrimp to the platter for an extra $11, but they were out of the shrimp. They were very nice about it and gave our friend a free dessert as an apology. \\nNeat place with chill vibes. Service is good and staff were very nice.', 'Came on a Thursday evening and had a lovely time! The place is a bit cozy and outdoor seating started filling up as the evening progressed, so I recommend making reservations. \\n\\nWe ordered all of their popular dishes that were boxed on the menu and they were all delicious and very savory! My favorites were the Pork Sisig and Pork Adobo Ribs, which came right off the bone. Highly recommend ordering a side of rice with the ribs to cut through its savoriness. For dessert, the Ube Pao baos were so yummy! It was my first time having anything like it and the coconut cream was a tasty addition to avoid a drier texture. \\n\\nThe staff here were phenomenal. They gave amazing recs and made us feel comfortable by combining a table for us since we ordered a bunch of dishes! Lol Overall, would recommend this spot for some elevated, classic filo dishes.', 'Finally made it to Kalye which means \"street\" in Tagalog. Menu had all my fave Filipino dishes. My friend and I shared lechón kare kare and the flavor was so amazing. It went perfect with a side of insal rice with a side of a hearty amount of insal chicken wings with a side of soy sauce mansi n suka vinegar. Drinks were mango juice , red horse beer and mango juice rose mansi cocktail.we were saddened by not to try UBE longanisa sliders and mushroom sisig which was sold out by this late Sunday afternoon. This was best time to go with no wait but sold out items which was trade off. Very intimate location with few tables and gender neutral bathrooms. Can\\'t wait for larger location to open down the street. Service was attentive with small crowd.', \"This is a modern Filipino restaurant near Chinatown/East Village that has a tight indoor seating but plentiful outdoor seating. If I do it again I'd opt for outdoor as the indoor space is really tight - they fit 6 of us in a table of 4 which makes it hard to enjoy all the dishes we ordered.\\n\\nWe got the Club 85 that is a miniature boodle fight format featuring lechon pork belly, lumpia, pork skewers, tangy inasal wings, grilled beef, and steamed veggies along with regular and inasal (garlic) rice. The garlic rice here is not as garlicky as the usual that I usually am familiar with, so it is a bit more subtle. The meat cuts here are pretty okay - there's way too much fat in the pork belly. The lumpia is a bit dry but the wings and beef were excellent. The rice is a bit inconsistent in the board - there was a portion of it that was way too soft for my liking but the rest were fine. You're encouraged to use your hands (gloves provided) for the full experience.\\n\\nWe also got ube longganida sliders that were my favorite savory dish here, with a very subtle ube flavor aside from the color. Pork sisig was good but still the fraction of the meat is a bit fatty. The pork adobo ribs were good but not memorable - it wasn't really worth the price tag of $30.\\n\\nFor dessert, we got the halo halo which is prepared as expected and the ube pao was a bit sweeter but I didn't really taste the ube there. Service is a bit of a miss as we were a large group but water refills were scarce, which is not okay since it was really hot outside and AC inside is pretty weak. Overall, I had a mostly positive experience but given the competition and the food scene in NYC, I expected more from this place; I was a little disappointed.\", \"My friends and I decided to stop by this place for lunch on a Saturday since we were in the area. We made reservations in advance and they were able to seat us immediately when we got there. The place itself isn't too big but very cozy and clean. The menu also isn't too large but definitely had something for everyone. Sadly the bartender was not here the day we went so we were not able to order any of the cocktails so we focused mainly on the food.\\n\\nWe got the Ube sliders which were pretty good in flavor. Since there was four of us we decided to get the Club 85 - which was HUGE, it was a lot of food and we were not able to finish all of it. If you are in a group we definitely recommend ordering this since it has a little of everything - you can add extra for the ribs which were also sold out the day that we went there. My favorites were the savory pork skewer and pork lechon. I was really excited for the lumpia but they were not as crispy as I would have liked it. But everything had great flavor in my opinion and we were stuffed when we left the place. \\n\\nWould recommend checking this place out if you are in the area!\", \"It is a small Filipino restaurant. The day I went was busy because they were having a graduation celebration. I'm so glad they were able to sit us. We got the club 85. It can definitely feed a party of 4 people. We were able to try a little of everything. I really loved it but wished the lumpia was crisper. We were told it's not as crispy because they air fried it. Hopefully they figure a way to make it crispier through the air fryer. Will come back to dine again but I'll make sure to have a reservation since it is a small establishment.\", \"The full experience was great. Just a little upset that they do not have mang tomas as part of the lechon sauce but over all the service is great! \\n\\nLGBTQ+ ADVOCATE FOR SURE! They got momma Ru's pic in the bathroom!!! \\n\\nShanghai and sliders are for sure my fave out of the stuffs we got from the menu!\", \"Kalye is a cute small filipino spot in the lower east side. We sat outisde and were seated promptly without reservations on a weekday night. \\n\\nWe ordered the club 85\\nThe presentation was impressive. The white rice was ok, the yellow rice was severely undercooked and hard, impossible to eat (how can an asian spot mess up rice, like cmon). The lumpia on the platter were soggy and cold and there was also random raw long beans sprinkled about, almost like a garnish?The skewers were delicious and the lechon was (mostly) crispy. \\n\\nThe halo halo was great, the ice was also ube flavored which was delicious.\\n\\nOverall, the restaurant has a cute vibe and the service was friendly enough. The food left a lot to be desired. The meat dishes were well balanced but the sides and vegetables were not. Undercooking rice is so disspointing and the food was served on the platter pretty room temperature. \\n\\nIt's nice for the vibe but pretty dissapointing food.\", 'An absolute treasure... a \"Joules gem\". \\n\\nThis restaurant is small but packs a mighty punch with their Filipino cuisine. I love a no-frills Filipino restaurant... that\\'s how I feel it is enjoyed best... as comfort food and not some fancy-schmancy thing. It gets busy so please make a recommendation to guarantee yourself a table. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for new and innovative ways to consume ube, look no further than trying Kalye\\'s ube sliders and ube pao. The ube pao was our dessert but it was my faaavvooorrritteee thing that I had... just because I have a really bad sweet tooth. But it was also really perfect. A soft bun with the halaya inside and coconut flakes on top... it was just the best combination as far as texture and flavors go.\\n\\nThe beef tapas was my next favorite thing. It was made perfectly... reminded me of being back in Manila and I haven\\'t been in years. lol. It paired so well with the inasal rice. My friend had the lechon and she loved it but felt like it was too fatty for her liking. The chicken inasal wings were also great! I feel like they would pair really well with a San Miguel... I\\'ll have to test that theory out during my next visit.\\n\\nThe artwork around the restaurant is so dope. Love that it\\'s all local and Filipino artists for the most part. The bathroom artwork really WOW\\'d me. I love the graffiti art and the Pride all over the walls... the rainbows, the painting of RuPaul.... Just YAAASSSS!!\\n\\nCustomer service here is also unmatched. They really keep tabs on you and make sure you\\'re enjoying your experience at Kalye!!\\n\\nHands down.... One of my top Pinoy spots in NYC that I recommend to everyone.', 'Went here recently and can say it was one of the best Filipino spots I have been to. It is such an amazing vibe especially on a Friday and Saturday night with great music and food. \\n\\nThe food was flavorful and tender (pretty good in price) and would have to come back to try again. Also service was pretty sweet and efficient.', \"We came upon a Phillipino-owned restaurant with lots of culturally inspired foods! We went as a group of 5 for a wednesday night reservation for a friend's birthday & were seated outdoors. The waiter was so kind to offer desserts on them due to there being no space inside the restaurant. He was extremely attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed despite it being a busy night for them.\\n\\nMy friends started off with some mango and coconut juice, and some eggplant salad. I dove straight for the combo 85, which we were told was only enough for 3 (it was enough for 5 for sure and we ended up taking leftovers home!). This was a great choice, as it gave us a chance to try a variety of dishes on their menu. \\n\\nThe ube pao was our free dessert and it completely tied the meal together, coconut flakes over ube baos, coated with coconut syrup, best of all, not too sweet!! \\n\\nTo top it off, we were invited to stay for karaoke night and seemed like a few regulars were visiting for the social gatherings. 10/10 would recommend!\", \"deserves all the hype and more! so so glad I finally got to try kalye because I will definitely be going back. the waiter was extremely nice and attentive -- he even brought us ube ice cream and a lychee juice can on the house!\\na group of four of us came at around 7:30 and was quickly seated on a sunday night. heard its a lot more busier on saturdays/noontime but there was still a bunch of people sitting around us and outside, so it's definitely a busy place. \\nwe shared the super 85, which was extremely worth it for the value. insane amount of food and a great selection to eat. there was lumpia, longinisa, bbq, wings, and so much more! the best part was that it was only $85, so you can def have a meal here for less than $25 and leave stuffed. \\nwe all also had the red horse beer, which is probably one of my favorite beers, but priced steeply at $10 each.\", \"Because I don't see a lot of Filipino food in Lower Manhattan, Kalye stands out and brings some really tasty flavor profiles. \\n\\nWhile I don't think the quality is the strongest in NYC, I do think their hospitality and ambiance create a perfect spot for dinner with friends/celebrations. Very friendly and communal as Filipino culture should be!\", 'Very good. Legit Filipino taste. We just wished to have meat portions than fat in our lechon and sisig', \"Came here to remember my grandma on the anniversary of her passing because Filipino food was her absolute favorite, and I'm so so glad we came here. \\n\\nService/ambiance: We booked the Friday before our Sunday dinner, and were glad we did so because it was busy! Both the outdoor and indoor were filled. Thank you very much to our server for accommodating our table switch (from the table in the back to the high table at the window). The food came out pretty quickly considering how big it was! \\n\\nFood: YUM! I'm Filipino so I was missing all of the options back in California (both at my parents' house and in the plethora of options in the surrounding area). This definitely hit the spot. Everything had a good amount of seasoning - and more importantly - was cooked well! The juiciness of all the meats were present. The only note was that some crunchy parts of the lechon were a bit hard to chew through - otherwise the other parts were delicious.\\n\\nDefinitely want to bring my parents here next time they visit NYC, and for whenever I'm missing Filipino food.\", \"We were a bit late to our reservation, and they seated us immediately anyway ! Really appreciated that. However, when I tried to pay with their mobile self-service webpage, they tried to charge me an extra $25 for service fees and catering fees ? Luckily I caught it and asked them for the paper check. This did not make me happy at all. \\n\\nThe food was unique and different from my usual pallet. More tangy and less salt. However, it was well made and tasted good. The ribs fell off the bone and the meat was juicy. The food was good otherwise I would've given a 3/5 for the overcharging fiasco above.\", 'Obsessed. I AM OBSESSED! Love Kalye. The food is just so good. Not only are the staff extremely friendly the minute you step in, but the small interior vibe is really dope. I love how LGBTQ friendly it is in the bathroom and the menu is small but simple. The appetizers are all good, especially their lumpia and sliders. The sliders are unique, sweet, and savory!\\n\\nFor entrees, I highly recommend the sisig and for dessert, definitely get their creamy and icy Halo Halo.', \"Came for a trip to NYC without any reservations anywhere and decided to try this place. Luckily was able to get easily seated as a walk in at 8pm on a Sunday. The staff was very attentive and gave me recommendations! I chose the pork sisig. It had a great flavor but a lot of the pork pieces were very fatty, which I should've known that likely would be the case. \\nThe star of the show was the ube pao dessert! That was the best dessert I've had in a while and I'm still thinking about it days after eating it. Highly highly recommend this delicious treat that you can share with others!\", 'Loved the Ube sliders here! Staff was super friendly and helpful. Great location, close to a lot of bars so we had a quick bite here and then walked around.', \"Was here for a friend's birthday and oh. My. GOODNESS! \\n\\nFood is to die for, great music and ambiance, and the wait staff were all incredible. The combination of meats, fruits (mango and pineapple - yum!) and sauces is just simply unbeatable. What an experience.\", \"(Overall: D) - Overall, Kalye provides an innovating insight into Filipino food. The place is a bit small but the decor is nice overall. I think the menu has quite a lot of classic Filipino options, but with their own twist -- what was noticeably missing is some refreshing greens. However, that being said, the my biggest complaint is the service here as our waiter was visibly unfriendly and when she spilled water on the table, she didn't bother cleaning it up or offering a napkin for us to clean it up. \\n\\n\\n(Ube Slider: C) - The pork sausage was well flavored and I like the sweetness that comes through. Unfortunately though, the slider was dominated by the bun, which was exceptionally dry.\\n\\n(Pork Lechon: B) - At first glance, this dish impresses with that crispy pork rind. The underpart of the pork belly is incredibly juicy and tender as well. Sadly, part of the pork rind is beyond burnt and I was looking for more of that pickle to cut through the fattiness of the dish.\\n\\n(Ube Sando: C) - I like the ube flavor coming through the ice cream. However, once again, the main component, the bun, is very dry. \\n\\n--\\n\\nFood: E\\nPresentation: E\\nPrice: E\\nAtmosphere: E\\nService: -1\\nMenu: E\\nOverall: -1 D\\n\\nInsta/Beli: @amei_eats\", 'The Ube sliders were light and fresh. The halo-halo is a good choice if you enjoy a dessert with plenty of ice, beans, and jello. The pork dish with string beans, eggplant, and bok choy was also tasty. Service is great and bathroom was clean but the restaurant space is a bit on the small side.', 'Went there on a date. Service was great- super friendly staff and very patient with us, but a star off because we got seated for outdoor seating despite our reservation for indoor seating. Food was good- I got the pork skewers (tender, juicy, the sweet and sour tang paired with the relish was nicely balanced to my palette), but the chicken wings were mid- I could get that most anywhere in NYC. I would have to go back to give this place a try again next time, with a bigger group maybe to try their share platters.', 'We ordered the platter for 3 and it did not disappoint! Everything was tasty and beautifully presented. The only con is that there are a lot of flies if you are seated outside. I recommend indoor seating during the summer! The staff were super nice. Highly recommend dining here if you are in the mood for Filipino food.', \"Came here with a friend for dinner and had a wonderful meal! There aren't many seats indoors (though they also have outdoor seating), so I recommend making a reservation.\\n\\nI ordered the pork adobo ribs and regret nothing. The portion was massive, and the flavor was on point. It's also served with some perfectly cooked potatoes. I highly recommend getting the inasal rice over the white rice to accompany this dish. While I took half of the ribs home, I chowed down on that rice. It's super flavorful and addictive.\\n\\nI also had a margarita mocktail, which was really refreshing. I'd definitely order again.\\n\\nCheck out this cute Filipino restaurant that showcases interesting local art.\", \"Very very delicious and fun experience! \\n\\nWe stumbled upon it after getting drinks and were famished so we decided to get the $85 Kamayan style one where it's basically everything family style.\\n\\nThe servers were sooo nice and telling us about each meat and sauces and checked up on us! (It is pretty small inside) \\n\\n\\nThey gave us free soup appetizers and it was salty yet sourrrr in the best way. A great palate refresher I would say. \\n\\nThe meat was tender and has amazing flavors of all kinds. There were three different sauces I believe, and two different kinds of rice- white and red rice? \\n\\nBecause there's so many things on the dish, the rice was a bit cold and some of the meat could be hotter but that's a personal preference thing for me as I like everything temperature wise very hot. Overall, I really enjoyed it and eating with friends made it fun. We did demolish it in 30 min and the servers were a bit shook we finished so fast ahaha\\n\\nThen we had to try the special dessert: chocolate cake! Not too chocolatey which I like because I don't like chocolate too much but texture wise very good and it was like a thin ganache on the outside and cream mouse and cake inside. I liked it especially after a meat heavy meal :) \\n\\nWould come back again and try the other dishes like the ube ones :))\", \"We came here for Sunday lunch with a party of 6. The restaurant mostly has high stool table and chairs. We ordered \\n\\n- pork sisig: their version is all mixed together. It doesn't have the crunchiness of the usual sisig \\n- pork lechon kare kare. The sauce was really good, with an addicting peanut sauce. The lechon lost its skin crunchiness though because of the sauce\\n- pork abodo ribs. The rub on the ribs was complex.\\n- inasal wings: fried wings with sauce that reminded me of char siu\", \"Was looking for a new neighborhood spot for brunch and came across Kalye. I'm giving it a 3 but I'll say it's closer to 3.5. The service started out good but ended pretty poorly. The restaurant is relativity small and had 4 staff members. 2 of which were cooks. Somehow during the meal, they lost one person. \\n\\nLet's talk about the food. The ribs were huge and unfortunately cold. They weren't raw but not reheated thoroughly through. The lumpia was good and so was the ube ice cream (not pictured). \\n\\nWe'll probably come back again but skip the ribs. And hopefully they'll be better staffed next time because trying to get their attention at the end was very difficult.\", 'Kalye, which means \"street\" in Tagalog, is a colorful and modern fast-casual Filipino restaurant in New York City\\'s Lower East Side. The space is small but intimate, with an open kitchen concept, friendly staff, and beautiful artwork.\\n\\n* Downeast Guava Passion Fruit $9.00\\nI don\\'t usually drink, but my partner does and this sounded really good... so good that I might\\'ve taken a few sips. I have to say, this perfectly balances the mild and sweet elements of guava with the tart and tangy notes of passion fruit, though it is expensive, considering that you can order a pack of 4 online for just a dollar more.\\n\\n* Crispy Lumpia (8pcs) $13.00\\nThin and crispy air-fried spring rolls filled with minced pork, carrots, and Chinese celery. I\\'m not a huge fan of celery (Chinese or not), so I\\'m really glad the savoriness of the pork masked the taste of the celery.\\n\\n* Ube Longganisa Sliders (2pcs) $13.00\\nEasily the highlight of our meal. The sliders were adorably cute and bite-sized, with soft and fluffy ube buns, sweet and savory pork sausage patties, lettuce, tomato, onion-bacon jam, aioli, and the most beautiful Swiss cheese pull I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\n* Pork Lechon $25.00\\nIncredibly underwhelming to say the least. The presentation was stunning, but the inasal rice tasted bland and day-old, the 4-hr roasted pork belly was dry, and the crispy pork rind was more burnt than crispy (I had to use my saliva to soften the rind just so I could bite it LOL).\\n\\n* Beef Tapa & Sunny Egg $25.00\\nAgain, the inasal rice tasted bland and day-old, but the beef tapa was delicious. It was sweet, savory, and garlicky, and paired perfectly with the sunny egg and tangy atsara.', 'Went here for a lunch on Sunday around 1 pm. We ordered the 3 person boodle fight and a pork sisig and it was plenty for us four! When it came out we were pleasantly surprised at how delicious and massive it was. The lumpia and sauces were great, the longganisa was absolutely the star- super juicy, flavorful and homemade. The lechon could have been less fatty and crispier, and the chicken was a little dry but the garlic rice was good and fluffy. There was some mango salad, eggplant and other veggies as well. The pork sisig could have been a little hotter and a little bit juicier but overall the experience and service was great! Would recommend.', 'Had this place on my radar for a bit, and finally got to try it! The restaurant is quite small and seems less smoothly run than larger spots, but the service is friendly and helpful.\\n\\nPork Kare-Kare -- my favorite dish of the night!

We love Filipino food in Los Angeles, so we wanted to try some authentic Filipino food in NYC. We saw Kalye on TikTok and decided to try it. It is not too large of a restaurant and they offer indoor and outdoor dining. Food and service was on the slower side which is understandable and we are patient. I will say our dishes that we received were okay for the most part, it wasn't great great, but it wasn't awful. We waited a while for the sliders and the meat was good but the buns were very hard.

The halo halo was not too sweet and you can really taste the ube flavor instead of it tasting just like cream with artificial color. There was also plantains and other items inside which made it that much better.

The lamb was so tender to the point where it would fall off the bone. The sauce paired so well with this dish as it provided a little bit of a kick. My only complaint with it was that it was a little greasy for the lamb. We got the basmati rice and it was a great addition to the dish. It is more of a 2 person dish because the portion is so big. \\n\\nWe also got the hummus and falafel and it was amazing. The hummus was well done and had a great texture.

No problem, we were still enjoying the bottle of champagne but I took out my credit card to pay. She immediately came to our table and entered the amount in her handheld device. She showed me the amount on the screen which gave the option for a tip. I took the device in my hand and entered the tip amount and signed on the device.

Reservation and wait time can fluctuate, but always great service. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating. They rotate drinks seasonally but have always loved the beetroot cocktail and ginger drinks. This time I ordered the cardamom Hot toddy which did not disappoint on a chilly NYC afternoon. I always get the Falafel and Hummus as an appetizer, best in town. For entrees we always order at least one tangine. Both chicken and lamb are good, but lamb is my favorite! The kale salad is great!

They said it has been there for a while from when they first moved into the neighborhood years ago. We sat inside next to the windows that were open since it was a nice day. The menu wasn't too big so it wasn't too hard to make a decision. We started with a falafel and tahini and hummus plate. The pita was very fluffy. The falafel was fairly big with a nice crunch. My friend got the chicken tagine and I got the lamb shank couscous. I personally don't like raisins so I had to pick them out. Thankfully there weren't too many of them. The whole dish was delicious. I finished the whole thing and even cleaned the lamb shank. It was a pretty big shank that came off the bone.

I had this cafe marked for the longest time and it did not disappoint. My friend got the french toast and I got the Middle Eastern Breakfast platter. The french toast had a citrusy taste which complemented the sweetness to the perfect taste. I mean it, it was perfect. Now the platter was the healthiest and most refreshing breakfast. If anyone asked if I'd eat salad for breakfast I would say no, but cafe mogador gave the tabouli and arabic salad a great flavor profile. It almost acted as a palate cleanser between my eggs and hummus/pita. Side note the pita was soooo good and hot sauce was Hot. I definitely will be returning for lunch and dinner! Everything was presented beautifully from the food to the decor to the service.\", \"BEST MOROCCAN FOOD ever!!!!\\n\\nThis cafe deserves 5/5. Everything I tried at Cafe Mogador was INCREDIBLE. My friend and I walked in without a reservation for Sunday brunch. \\n\\nBetween the two of us: we ordered a mezze of Labne with Zàatar for an appetizer. Zàatar was earthy and tangy and pita served with it was so soft. I also ordered Moroccan Tagine with Chicken in Lemon & Olive sauce. They have 3 more sauce options to choose from. This dish stole the show for me. One of the best I tried at this cafe. Apparently, it's a slow cooking dish like a stew with all spices blended in so well. The flavors were mouth watering. My friend ordered Middle Eastern breakfast. It had hummus, Tabouli and Arabic salad. \\n\\nI was particularly impressed by Turkish Coffee - one of the best Turkish coffees I ever had - thick, velvety texture of the sediment at the bottom which wasn't too strong or bitter. \\n\\nThough Moroccan mint tea was somewhat below average for me. \\n\\nThe staff was attentive, provided the right recommendations as we loved everything. The ambience was low key, warm, authentic and had very family friendly vibe. \\n\\nHighly recommend this place for absolutely delicious Moroccan food. Can't wait to come back and try rest of their menu!\", \"I can see why they have such high ratings. The service was great and the atmosphere was too. I would like to go back again. There's a back patio area that is closed off, which makes the indoor area extended. It gives the restaurant a different feel when you go towards the back area.\\n\\nFor the food, we ordered the hummus plate and the mixed grill. The mixed grill has three different types of meat, such as chicken, sausage, and lamb. I enjoyed the lamb and sausage the most. The chicken was a bit dry. The hummus had a bit of chili oil in it, so it tasted good. Overall, I would like to go back and try other things off the menu.\", \"To notch service, great food. Diverse and great bistro style cafe in the 'burg! Service excellent. Tables close to each other so love thy neighbor and ask them for a bite! Had the Moroccan eggs. Nice twist with roasted eggplant instead of meat (note if you're vegan or trying to go meatless this is a great place for you bc you don't have to sacrifice flavor or textures). All well cooked and flavorful. Coffee was good roasted flavor but your sbux super strong burnt coffee and they come around and keep it filled. Little line outside in the summer but wait not too long and plenty of shops nearby to look in while you wait. All in all a great Mediterranean cafe to try.\", \"Since I have never tried Moroccan food before, my friends introduced me to Cafe Mogador in Brooklyn!\\nI AM IN LOVE\\n\\nThe menu is a mix of Moroccan and Mediterranean dishes and full of robust flavors.

The Falafal Hummus Platter arrives with a nice saucer-plate size amount of Hummus but would do better with six (6) Falafals instead of four (4). They're good but both Hummus and Falafals NEED a touch of salt to bring out their best flavors.\\nSame with the Lamb Shanks in the Tagine dishes. Both Tagines needed accompanying sauces, the Chickpea with Caramelized Onions and the Chermoulla to make the lamb sing. However, the best sauce was the garlicky, herby Chermoulla, which should be bottled and sold. We HAD TO request MORE!!!\\nThe Grilled Lamb Keftas were seasoned well and charred nicely over a bed of Jasmine rice and grilled tomatoes. \\nThe Kale salad was mountainous with matchstick cut added red apple slivers. It comes dressed in a light vinaigrette. A grilled piece of Salmon was added, which turned it into a full-sized meal. \\nWe had a small bowl of both their hot sauce, which, again, needed salt to be its best and their ketchup, which was delish. The ketchup tasted housemade but could've been a premium organic brand. It was tangy and full of flavor. We used the ketchup to flavor the Falafals and Hummus. \\nThe Cheesecake is lemon based, not too tart. Homemade crust was a cross between shortbread and Graham cracker crust. The texture of the cake was a mix between light and dense, like Cheesecake Factory & Junior's had a lovechild. It was covered in a mild Caramel sauce with four (4) slivers of red apples. Really good!\\nThey had a good variety of cocktails and Old World wines, with a decent mix of styles: Alvarinos, Lambeuscos and CdPs. The table RAVED about their fresh Lemonade. It was REALLY good! Also, strong Turkish coffee to end the night. \\nOverall, excellent dining experience and would definitely return with more family and friends!\", \"came with a friend for sunday brunch, no res, but they were still able to seat us quick!\\nit was about 2pm and they ran out of my top pancake pick, understandable. the food was pretty good but nothing really stood out. come for a comforting meal but don't expect to be surprised!\\ncute interior, a bit cramped but well decorated :)\", \"One of my favorite restaurants in Williamsburg! \\n\\nThe zaatar chicken OH MY GOD.

Service was attentive and helpful. \\n\\nI thought the tagine's suace and the lamb meat were flavorful, but I think it could've been better if the rice was at the bottom and soaked up all that flavor like how it is done in Morocco. \\n\\nAmbiance was really great, but wish it was a bit more light inside. \\n\\nOverall, such a tasty meal and I will be back! Highly recommend.\", \"RATING (for dinner): 8.4/10 \\n\\nPRO TIP: Come here for brunch; I originally tried the Manhattan location for brunch and it's still one of my top 5's, it's pretty solid for dinner though and everything is quality. But imo brunch over dinner by a little bit.\\n\\nCHICKEN TAGINE & COUSCOUS\\nMoroccan food is a hard find in NYC. The chicken was delectably tender, and delicious. The sauce was bold and flavorful, though the entire dish itself I thought was small on the portion size. The chicken really just falls of the bone. Got couscous on the side, which was light, fluffy, and very fine, kind of almost like polenta. Buttery and delicious. The great part about eating food here is that it feels so healthy yet delicious. I would not fight anyone if they recommended coming back.\\n\\nFINAL RANKING: GREAT \\n(terrible / bad / ok / good / GREAT / excellent)\", 'Came here with a party of 4 plus a baby around 6pm on a Friday and got seated right away in the greenhouse.

Not fishy at all\\n\\nPastilla - filo was very buttery and I liked all the sweet and savory flavors', 'We have dined here numerous times. When we came this time around 6 pm the place had MANY empty tables.  The hostess said they were all reserved and that we could eat out in the \"garden\" area and that they had space heaters.  This was the coldest day so far in NY with 0 degree wind chill.  To make a long story short the space heater wasn\\'t working and to make matters worse the hostess as well as other workers knew the heater was not working.  The hostess said there was nothing to be done and she could seat us at the bar. We left.  They lost a good loyal customer.', \"My husband surprised me by making reservations at Cafe Mogador Friday night. The food and service were very good. Ambiance was welcoming. The fried cauliflower for appetizer was delicious. My entree was fabulous and so was my husband.I would again and try their other dishes. \\nThe only thing I didn't enjoy was how small the tables for two were.\", 'Café Mogador is a crowd fav in the city for Moroccan food and offers exquisite traditional dishes and comfort food. The tagines are not to be missed, in particular the lamb and fish tagines are so savory and tender. Highly recommend getting a couple if you have a group, each is great for sharing between 2-3 people. The jalapeño cheese naan oozes with cheese and is great for spreads. Humus and babaghanoush are super fresh, also loved the halloumi starter, like fried cheese served with grilled tomatoes and pita. My friends and I also loved the bastilla, which was a pastry with savory chicken inside. Their brunch menu looked really great for daytime. Definitely make a reservation beforehand and bring people with you to order lots of options!', \"If you've ever met someone who's been to Cafe Mogador, they will rave about it (it also was featured on a late night Williamsburg munchies video a while back). It was a long time coming, but I finally can say I went. My favorite thing I had here was definitely my drink. Forgot to take a photo, but opted for the Heartbeet cocktail because apparently I'm a sucker for a cocktail these days. It was a beautiful deep purple color and delicious! Reminiscent of a sangria but with more of a punch due to the tequila. I would come back here just for that drink. \\n\\nFor food me and one other person split the halloumi, labne, tandoori chicken (was a special) and the chicken tagine in the apricot plum sauce. I thought the small plates were fine, but nothing extraordinary. The tagine was great, though. We got it with the couscous which had a great texture and I loved the whole dried plums and apricots that were in the sauce. In comparison to the hype of the restaurant, I'd probably give it a 3/5 but it was a solid meal (and not too expensive)!\", \"SO. GOOD.\\n\\nI love mediterranean food as much as the next person, but the fact that everything my group and I ordered were amazing with no misses, it says a lot. \\n\\nWe ordered a little of everything for apps and nothing missed. Flavor profile was spectacular and even the kale salad, which I don't usually go for, was done so right it's now my favorite thing to eat. \\n\\nI got their crispy salmon plate and there was nothing that needed improvement.

I thought to myself, \" Wow, I picked a popular spot\"!.\\nI was greeted and seated in the back of dining room, near outdoor dining. My table had the bench part adorned with pillows ( love it!).  I was greeted by my waiter Pedro. I knew I wanted the poached  eggs with Halloumi, stewed tomatoes, salad and Zaa\\'taar pita. \\nI decided to forgo coffee and ordered the mint lemonade. I really was into the ambience of the place and as I dipped my lemonade the vibe really lifted my Monday blues.\\nThen my dish came and it looked delicious... now I\\'m not a poached egg type of diner and decided to try it. I sliced the egg carefully and the yolk oozed and then i strategically placed a bit of pita, Halloumi, salad and tomato and then pressed REPEAT throughout my meal. \\nEvery bite was downright delicious, the pita had a spicy kick to it.

Within this eatablishment is a hustling and bustling cafe, yet it never felt frantic and uncontrolled inside. The staff were busy yet never overwhelmed and their service was excellent. We were seated quickly and presented the menu right as we sat down. Our waiter was great at explaining the unique offerings. We both opted to get eggs Benedict, where I got the Moroccan and she got the Norwegian. She also had a plain coffee while I tried their Elderflower Rosemary Spritz. She said her coffee was good. My Spritz was pretty good, although I didn't taste much of the Elderflower in it. The food itself was fantastic. We didn't get to try each other's food but both of us kept commenting on the speed of preparation, presentation, and the flavors. The spicy tomato sauce they gave us on the side was indeed spicy, but full of flavor. I put it all over my food. The eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly, and the accompanying side salad was a nice finish to the entree. I wish the portions were bigger, but they were definitely suffice to say the least \\n\\nWe opted to share a cheesecake afterwards. I don't remember what kind it was. It had a topping reminiscent to a gravy made of apples and cinnamon, and it came with some slices on the side. The cheesecake was fantastic and it was pretty hard for me to not destroy it in seconds in front of my date, as we were sharing it. Overall, Cafe Mogador was an excellent place for brunch. I would definitely recommend it if you wanted to go on a date, or even to catch up with a friend. The location isn't too crazy in terms of parking too, as I found it right around the corner. We did visit on a Sunday, so that could have been a factor. It's also worth noting that there's a park nearby where you could walk afterwards, and the view is really nice. It would make a perfect end to a brunch here. High recommended by yours truly. The only reason I didn't opt for 5 stars was the lack of flavor in the Spritz. I also think the pricing is a little high in relation to the portions of the food. Don't let any of that deter you from visiting however, as this restaurant was still amazing. Shame that my date wasn't as good as this cozy restaurant, but had I not gone, I may have never found this hidden gem\", \"When I'm craving for Middle Eastern food and no idea for the good new place, Cafe Mogador is a backup plan, especially on Saturday when some authentic middle eastern type of place is closed. Their table is small, and they have nice backroom space. I always seated at the front, so I don't know how the backyard feel like. \\n\\nThis time I had soup of the day, which was tomato soup: delicious and I loved it. Kefta Kebab: it was ok and satisfied kebab hunger, LOL. Baklava was also good, and I couldn't complain it. Service was friendly and super casual. \\n\\nThe place is always trendy and family welcome, I see lots of customers bring kids and toddler. The highlight is, they open earlier than a regular restaurant so if you want to have a breakfast, you can come to this restaurant.\", \"Sat. June 1st, 6pm dinner reservation:  So glad i chose Mogador to introduce moroccan cuisine to my 23yr old daughter! My mother grew up in Rabat, and I spent 8 summers there as a kid visiting w/family (1964-1972). \\n\\nWe ordered the chicken and lamb shank tagines, the bastilla, the merguez sausage and closed with a pot of mint tea. They were all delicious and represented the food i ate as a kid. \\n\\nSpecial props to our server Cat, and our hostess Shannon, who were both exceptional!  The vibe was great, and I highly recommend the place to everyone!\\n\\nPS - since i forgot to take pics of our dinner, here's some pics of my mom from back in the day. :)\", \"My friend and I were exploring Brooklyn and found Cafe Mogador in the neighborhood. So glad we stopped in because the ambiance here was immaculate and the food was so flavorful. We did a walk-in instead of reservation so the wait was a bit long, but we did come in on a Friday night and the restaurant was on the smaller side and was packed. The food wait was also on the longer side, but again, it was a busy Friday night.\\n\\nHummus/Falafel Platter (5/5): \\nThe hummus was on the grainier side, which is my preference because I love the texture. The falafel was beautifully green in the middle, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. This was a well-made staple.\\n\\nMerguez Sausage Rice Plate (5/5):\\nI don't know how they make their sausage, but it was so flavorful with a subtle kick that paired so incredibly well with the cucumber yogurt and rice for the perfect bite. The presentation of the sausage on the rice made me laugh a bit and slightly skeptical but it was simply delicious.\\n\\nLamb Tangine w/ Charmoulla Green Herbs & Couscous (4/5):\\nThe lamb was fall-off-the-bone tender, and did not have that strong distinct lamb odor at all. The slight tartness of the charmoulla herb sauce cuts the heaviness of the meat, so I didn't get sick of the giant dish after a few bites of the meat. I took off 1 point because I felt like it didn't pair well with the couscous, but that's just a personal opinion.\", \"This charming neighborhood restaurant offers a delightful brunch menu and an intriguing drink selection. The pita bread is soft and delicious, though the fries are slightly crispier than my preference. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile dining destination that I'd revisit for a meal or cocktails.\\n\\nService is excellent, striking the right balance between friendly and prompt without being pushy. We started with hummus and babaganoush and everything was amazing. Warm bread would have enhanced the experience though. The rest of the meal was excellent and delicious as well. \\n\\nThis cute brunch spot combines a Middle Eastern twist with tasty cocktails. The brunch options are excellent, featuring herby, Middle Eastern bread and appealing egg dishes. The leafy-roofed patio is a perfect summer touch.\", 'I really enjoyed my Moroccan eggs dish. It was tasty and filling. \\n\\nThe chicken terrine was great! You can choose between 4 sauces- my wife got the chickpea based sauce and it was really good. \\n\\nWe intended to eat more afterwards but we were so stuffed! This restaurant is great for a flavorful and hearty meal.', \"Yummy yummy yummy. A few of my favorite things are the lamb, labneh, and olive oil washed martini. I've only ever come in the evenings which are busy but service is always good. Ambiance is nice and it is great for groups as they have enough seating. Haven't checked out the one in Manhattan but looking forward to it.\", 'Went with a few friends, great ambiance, service, food and drinks. Pictured is the lamb shank moroccan tangine with Casablanca sauce which was amazing. The meat was falling off the bone and perfectly cooked. Not pictured but note worthy: Moroccan meatballs (from the specials menu).', \"This spot delivered on food, drinks, and service. We had to wait about 30 minutes on a Sunday evening at 730 but it was worth it. The margarita was the best drink I've had in weeks. The Casablanca tagine was amazing and the best dish of the night. The blackened zatar chicken was very good, but a bit heavy when paired with the smashed potatoes and the herb salad was not my favorite.  I loved the ambiance however and I'd go back just for the cocktail alone!\", \"This is a solid brunch spot in Williamsburg. We walked in on Saturday around 1 pm with no reservation and it was packed. We had to wait around 30 min for a table, but it was worth it. \\n\\nThe interior is beautifully decorated and gives a rustic feel. The service was also pretty attentive. I ordered the middle eastern breakfast and it came with 2 eggs, hummus, 2 salads, and pita. The hummus tasted freshly made, paired with the cucumber tomato salad, it was very refreshing. The pita was also wonderfully fluffy. It was covered in some green spices, which made it a bit messy to eat. \\n\\nWe also got the fries with a side a harissa ketchup. The harissa added the perfect kick and the fries were good. \\n\\nI would come back for dinner as it seems their lamb and chicken dishes are good. Most of the brunch menu seemed similar to each other, so I'd love to try some of their other dishes.\", \"Cafe Mogador in Williamsburg is an exceptional restaurant that captured my heart. The warm ambiance, attentive service, and outstanding flavors transported me straight to the streets of the Middle East. The inviting decor and mood lighting sets the stage for a relaxed and enjoyable meal.\\n\\nTheir menu offers a delightful journey through Middle Eastern cuisine, with diverse options for all tastes and I was delighted by the plethora of choices. The creamy hummus and warm pita bread were divine, and the traditional Mixed Grill plate was perfectly cooked and packed with flavorful vegetables and aromatic spices.\\n\\nTo finish, the sweet and heavenly walnut baklava was simply irresistible. The staff's attentive and friendly service, along with their knowledge of the menu and ability to cater to dietary restrictions, made me feel like a valued guest throughout my visit.\\n\\nCafe Mogador is a true gem and I'm proud that it can be found in my city/borough: Brooklyn. I highly recommend Cafe Mogador for an authentic Middle Eastern dining experience that will leave you wanting more. I cannot wait to return.\", 'If you want to enjoy the food, spice and aroma of Morocco just visit Café Mogador. I have been going to their Village location for many years and just tried their Brooklyn spot. It is the same quality food, service and comfortable décor. They have a wonderful specialty drink selection which are so unique. The food is traditionally prepared, was so delicious and happy the portions were large. The meal is so good I keep thinking about my next visit!', \"pretty big for a NYC spot, I was surprised by how much seating they had. We went around 5:30 on a Thursday without a reservation and got seated immediately, but by the time we were leaving it was packed and I'd assume a reservation would be better at that time. \\n2 of us shared 3 mezze plates and 3 shared plates. We were very full and probably didnt need everything. If we had ordered an entree I know that we wouldn't have needed as much. \\nThe mezze we got were the matbucha, labneh, and olive & pickles. Definitely get the matbucha, it was a little spicy, chefs kiss! \\nThe shared plates we got were the hummus & falafel, the kale salad, and the halloumi. Falafel was great, the kale salad was surprisingly great, as it wasn't something I thought I'd love at a middle eastern spot, and the halloumi portion was a little disappointing for the price. \\nI loved my G & Tea cocktail and my sister loved her martini!\", \"The penultimate Williamsburg brunch place! You can't go wrong by with anything on the menu here but all the variations on eggs are the best (as are the brunch cocktails).\\n\\nBe expected to wait a bit on weekends but it tends to go pretty fast. Love the outdoor, covered, heated seating and the indoors is wonderful as well.\\n\\nHaven't been here for dinner but it's high on my list! Check this out the next time you're in Williamsburg or their sister location in the East Village.\", \"I really enjoyed the food here. I had the hummus and halloumi cheese for appetizers with my friends. Great to share and all tasted great. For entire, I shared the mixed grill dish. It comes with a variety of kebabs and white rice. The meat was super tender and juicy! Not overly salty and paired well with the white rice. Service was good but they definitely don't want to sit at your table for too long as they are super busy. Ambiance is cozy and intimate, great for date night!\", \"We were back east from the left coast visiting with family and our sons in Crooklyn and New Yawk and we ended up having dinner here one night. Of all the meals we had this past week in and around NYC this one rose close to the top of the pile. Solid Moroccan style meal prepared well and with good service and overall value and taste. I will say that oddly the hummus tasted watery and a little flat but everything else was genuinely tasty and well prepared. Four of us ate well for a total of $280 including tip and in today's world that fares well I suppose. I would have liked the lamb tagine to taste like the authentic ones we ate in Morocco a few years ago but this was a decent facsimile. Solid meal. Recommended.

We loved our waiter, Kadir! We really loved the holiday decorations as well.', \"I had the most incredible birthday dinner at Da Andrea! The atmosphere was absolutely enchanting, with its warm, cozy charm and lively energy. The service was impeccable--attentive, friendly, and seamless from start to finish.\\n\\nAs for the food, every bite was a delight. The Tigelle Modenesi con Prosciutto and Burrata appetizers were absolute perfection, while the pasta carbonara as my main course was rich, creamy, and packed with flavor. I couldn't recommend this spot more for a special night out--Da Andrea truly delivers an unforgettable dining experience.\", \"Celebrated a friend's birthday dinner last night. This was probably the longest and most unprofessional wait for a table that we've had to endure. Reservation was for 7pm. We weren't seated until 7:45pm because they didn't manage their customer's expectations for the reserved table at 7pm. The worst part is they didn't have a proper waiting area so our group of 8 had to be awkwardly standing by the end of the bar because the bar was also already crowded btw. The hostess couldn't give us an estimate of time and there was another female waitress who couldn't even be bothered to say 'Excuse me' whenever she passed through us, the most awkward situation. We've also seen at least 10 other tables get seated. They should be properly trained as customer-facing people and how to at least apologize for the inconvenience.\\n\\nThe good part is the restaurant's interiors are bright & pretty. Once we were finally seated, our waiter starts to get drinks and really wants to upsell bottles of wine. We all want different drinks so we don't do bottles. You could already sense our frustration that the waiter still wants to do it his way and doesn't take into consideration the 45 min. wait or perhaps acknowledge it even to lighten the mood. He insists to take the drinks first then he will come back to take our order for the appetizers even if we were all set to give it to him. It's his way or nothing. \\n\\nDrinks came. Appetizers were good because everyone's famished at this point. Frito Misto was good, the Baked Buns were good. Entrees were served. Pastas were all generally good but the birthday celebrant and another friend who ordered Filet Mignon found it fatty. More drinks. Then we ordered desserts, Tiramisu for the celebrant, Creme Brulee for the table and the Chocolate Walnut with Salted Caramel for us, which was the best out of everything. They gave 3 additional desserts on the house because the $36 was in their mind enough to compensate us for the long wait and inconvenience of standing and waiting for 45 mins. \\n\\nAfter paying $805.47, we were so ready to move somewhere. Unfortunately for all of us, this was a highly recommended restaurant that we were excited to try and experience but didn't really wow us. Rough start for the year. Hope they learn how to treat their customers right and value their time better. There's too many other fantastic Italian restaurants out here and the competition is tough, so there will always be options if they don't really wish for repeat customers.\", \"The only thing keeping me from giving Da Andrea 5 stars is the constant rush that was put on us from the moment we were seated. And listen, I get it, this is a popular spot with only so many tables. You have reservations coming in after us, we know. But starting things off by telling us you'll need to put some pressure on us to order moments after handing us a menu is a little much.\\n\\nThat said, Da Andrea is a beautiful restaurant with delicious food and cocktails, so it makes sense that so many people want to eat here. Not sure what it's like when it isn't Christmastime but the tree and all the decor here is honestly magical. \\n\\nWe kicked things off with a few rounds of cocktails, then shared a Fritto Misto and one of the best caesar salads I've ever had in my life, made with anchovies and fresh croutons. The fresh foccacia bread they put on the table also deserves its own shout out -- light, airy, crispy. Perfection. \\n\\nI went with the seafood ravioli for my main which was creamy and delicious, topped with decadent salmon pieces. I'm honestly not a dessert person but at that point I knew I needed to try whatever this place had to offer, and the chocolate walnut cake with sea salt ice cream blew my mind. Sweet, salty, crunchy. Everything a dessert should be. \\n\\nIf you can get a reservation at this place, I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.\", \"My family surprised me with a birthday dinner here, and I was absolutely blown away. This gem of a restaurant is located on a quiet street in Chelsea. To our surprise, we found parking right in front of the restaurant on a Sunday night.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is stunning. The exterior is beautifully decorated with pink flowers, and as soon as I stepped inside, I felt transported to an elegant greenhouse.\\n\\nOur group of nine opted for the pre-fixe menu at $89 per person, which included three courses. For my meal, I chose the Burrata Con Basilico as my starter, the Cappellacci Tartufo E Porcini as my entrée, and the Tortini Di Cioccolato for dessert. This meal was so delicious that just writing about it makes my mouth water all over again.\\n\\nThe Cappellacci Tartufo E Porcini, essentially a truffle ravioli, was my absolute favorite. It was buttery, flavorful, and packed with truffle in every bite. It was a 10/10 for me! There wasn't a single part of this meal I could complain about.\\n\\nI could tell everyone enjoyed their meals because there wasn't a leftover box in sight. The amazing service truly topped off the entire experience.\\n\\nThis was one of the best birthday dinners I've ever had. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for exceptional food, great ambiance, and amazing service!\", \"Cute and quaintly elegant eatery in Chelsea. I had made a reservation for 2 (people) at 3 (pm). I walked in about 20 minutes early and I told my hostess that I had a reservation for *2 at 3* and that I was a bit early. Even after giving her my name, I had to still repeat myself 2 times, bless her heart. She went to sit me at a table but when I asked if we could be seated at a table by the window, she told me to wait at the bar. Which was okay, but she ended up forgetting about me. Only upon me asking her again did she bring me to the table. \\n\\nThe service and the food overall were okay. I had the Poached Pear Salad (with grilled shrimp) and my friend had the Salmon dish. We are not drinking alcohol currently so I had a mocktail. Since my friend and I are both on a consistent long-term health regimen, we didn't quite tap into the Italian specialties so I cannot comment on any of those dishes.\", \"So many restaurants in New York and so little time.\\n\\nNeeded a last minute dinner reservation on a Saturday and Da Andrea did not disappoint. \\n\\nIt's a little cramped in there and was very busy. We were seated and then greeted by a very friendly server, who had great recommendations and knew the menu inside and out. \\n\\nWhen in New York, order a Manhattan and to stay awake also order an espresso martini. Both drinks were delicious. We started out with the frito misto that had a nice light batter to it and came with this avocado dripping sauce that was quite good. \\n\\nFor our mains we went with the Ribeye special to share and two half plates of pasta- the  GNOCCHETTI DI PATATA with Gorgonzola and CAVATELLI DI RICOTTA  with pesto. We also got the full sized shrimp scampi dish and WOW! That pasta was the lightest best texture I've ever had and the dish overall very flavorful.\\n\\nWe also ordered the tiramisu and crème brûlée. I don't know where we managed to find space in our stomachs for it but we did it! \\n\\nAMAZING.\", 'My husband and I don\\'t normally go out for Italian food. We usually stick to our fave Thai and Japanese  spots. But we decided to pick a spot that we heard makes exceptional pasta.\\n\\nWe started with a prosciutto appetizer that was really different for us since I\\'m used to prosciutto appetizers accompanied by burrata and tomato - this came with this \"pizza Frita\" (fried dough) looking flatbreads. The warm bread paired exceptionally well with the prosciutto and it made the prosciutto the star.\\n\\nI then had a truffle tortellini with mushroom and cheese. It was out of this world. Like soft pillows melting in my mouth good.\\n\\nDa Andrea restored my faith in NY Italian restaurants. Everything is fresh and hand-made, you can tell from each bite.\\n\\nOh, and it\\'s just such a perfect date night spot. Super romantic and intimate place to reconnect with your partner.', 'The restaurant can be recognized from afar by the beautiful purple flowers hanging above the front entrance. The inside also has an elegant Italian decor. Waiter was friendly and checked on us often. Food here was delicious. We tried multiple pastas and they were all perfectly cooked and packed full of flavor. The desserts were similarly spectacular. They even gave us an extra dessert on the house. Good wine selection. The old fashioned was just okay. Overall, had a wonderful brunch here and would recommend for good Italian food.', 'Kaled was amazing and treated us very well. The steak was cooked to perfection. The drinks were also very well made and the ambiance here is perfect for a date night. Not too crowded and ample space in the restaurant so it does not feel crammed either', \"Da Andrea has a great vibe at dinner time, enabled by warm lighting and rustic décor.  I visited their Chelsea location for dinner with a friend, and had an amazing end-to-end experience.  \\n\\nWe were seated comfortably by the window.  The bread basket came first.  The breads had a distinct flavor and texture, complemented by the olive oil served on the side.  At the suggestion of Kaled, the Maître d' and manager, I had the Coco Loco, a blend of pineapple puree, coconut milk, and lime.  It was tropical and creamy but not too sweet.  My friend had the anguriello, a mix of watermelon puree, lime, mint, and club soda.\\n\\nFor starters, I had the leeks and potato soup, which was warm and comforting.  My friend went with the heirloom tomato salad, which was both healthy and flavorful, with cherry tomatoes and a sprinkling of oregano.  And for the main course, I opted for the risotto del giorno, which was red beet risotto topped with goat cheese--an excellent dish.  My friend ordered the margherita flatbread, which was crispy and sizeable.  To finish off the meal, I had the Tortino di Cioccolato, a chocolate walnut cake with salted caramel ice cream--a decadent treat. My friend chose the Tortino di Mele, an apple tart served with vanilla ice cream.  The desserts were a fitting end to a fabulous meal.\\n\\nThe service was exceptional throughout the evening. Our server was attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. Kaled added a personal touch by periodically checking on us.  Overall, dining at Da Andrea was a wonderful experience. The food, ambiance, and service were all outstanding, and I'll be sure to return soon!\", 'Food was amazing and so was the service! Felt so welcomed here and will definitely be back. Our server was Kadir and he was great! Highly recommend this restaurant. Best in Chelsea!', \"First time in the city and after detailed research we decided on Da Andrea for our first night. I had such high hopes.\\nThe atmosphere was 100% good vibes, a little loud but you're in the city. \\nOur server was great, so knowledgeable with all the specials and recommendations. It was a very busy night on a Friday so she wasn't very attentive but you can tell she was trying to keep up. \\nI ordered the Risotto special with Burrata, the risotto was perfect but I wish there were more tomatoes and the cheese wasn't so cold. My husband ordered the Carbonara, such a classic. Unfortunately it was a little bland and needed more sauce. \\nThe olive oil/black olives and focaccia started was all I needed along a glass of cabernet! \\nIn all honesty, I'm afraid I'll try other places before coming back.\", 'Sadly wanted to love this place more than I did - we called earlier and updated our reservation from 4 to 5 people however it was not registered in the system for some reason so even though we made a reservation, we had to wait a long time to be seated it was super packed, the interior decor was beautiful and a very intimate romantic vibe - some of the pasta was good but my pasta dish (cavatelli di ricotta) was super oddly salty, service was really good thought and they gave us dessert on the house for a birthday tiramisu which was super delicious', 'Regrettably, just a \"meh\". Two butternut squash soups came out less than warm. We declined them and said no need to bring them back, because we didn\\'t want them microwaved. 3 minutes later, the bowls returned with piping hot soup, and the manager, who graciously comped the soups. We tried the soup and finished half, as the flavor wasn\\'t there. Gnocchi w/ a request for bolognese also missed the mark, as the pasta was gummy and the sauce lacking in flavor. The spaghetti carbonara was much better, and was the highlight of the night. Pasta was perfectly cooked, and the sauce tasty. Service was very attentive. Maybe we caught the kitchen team on a bad night? Regardless, there are better Italian restaurants in NYC.\\n\\nCheers!\\nRS', \"Lovely restaurant with a vibrant yet relaxing vibe! They also take reservations for brunch which is great to have when you don't want to wait hours.\\n\\nFood was excellent as well! Got to try their Lobster Benedict and Cacio de Pepe Spaghetti, both flavorful and decadent (and really filling). Service was already really friendly! Thank you to our server, Giulia, for the great service :)\", \"This review is for weekend brunch. I was a bit weary this place was just a tourist trap, but was pleasantly surprised. Food was nothing crazy that I would go out of my way for, but it's a solid brunch spot if you're in the area and the ambiance is really nice. This would be a good spot for a girls brunch, Mother's Day, etc. Came around 12pm and was one of the only people. Restaurant is pretty large for NYC standards and would be good for larger groups. Service was great. \\n\\nFood wise, I ordered:\\n\\n-Omelette: pretty standard, but exactly what I wanted. Egg was fluffy and had plenty of toppings inside. Comes with potatoes and a side salad. Would order again. \\n\\n-French Toast: not sure why it's an appetizer because it's standard size. Comes with some fresh strawberries. Not too sweet. Would order again.\", \"First off, the restaurant is beautiful inside and out! The staff were very friendly and attentive. We went for my friend's birthday and yes they do birthday desserts! \\n\\nI believe it is hard to find authentic decent italian food and I would definitely come back to this restaurant. It has been on my bookmarks for a long time as well! \\n\\nI'd recommend this to anyone, especially for a date night  And it's good for large groups as well.\", \"I recently visited Da Andrea, having been invited through Yelp to try their quick bites. Following that, the restaurant graciously invited me to sample their full menu. Unfortunately, our experience started off on a rough note. The server seemed to misunderstand our invitation and was initially quite rude, which was disappointing. He was not very friendly and explained the dishes in a rather unhelpful manner.\\n\\nDespite this rocky start, the food at The Andrea was enjoyable, and the ambience was excellent. The server's attitude improved noticeably when it came time to handle the tip, which was bad\\n \\nOverall, while the service could use some improvement, the quality of the food and the restaurant's atmosphere make it worth a visit. I hope the service issues are addressed, as the culinary experience itself was positive.\", 'Love this place.\\nYou want good food, get the whole menu. Spaghetti carbonara is what your heart wants. French toast is what your eyes and stomach want. Their great cocktails are what you and your 2-3 brunch friends want.\\n\\nService is quick kind and respectful.\\n\\nThe inside looks like Tuscany teleported to Manhattan.', \"We dined here for a friends birthday. Earlier side with 6:30 PM reservation. \\n\\nUpon entry it's like walking into a secret garden. The staff are all very hospitable and friendly. Menu is expansive and prices aren't too bad considering the location. \\n\\nFood wise we ordered:\\n\\nBurrata (4/5): solid crowd pleaser \\nMussels (3/5): generous dish but the accompanying bread was a smidge too thick and hard and mussels were quite small \\n\\nThe truffle mushroom ravioli (5/5) star of the evening and we ordered this as an app to share. Perfection. \\n\\nEntrees: overall 4/5\\nShareable steak dish with 1/2 portions of pasta for each guest (5/5) meat was ample, and cooked perfectly. They didn't even touch the pasta they were so full.\\n\\nSquid ink clam pasta (3/5) perfectly el dente like all the other pasta dishes, sauce was a bit bland and clams were super tiny. Dish itself was very big.\\n\\nShort rib dish (4/5) can't speak directly but high ratings from my friend who ordered it and looked divine \\n\\nFor dessert:\\nTiramisu and crème brûlée \\nBoth were solid choices and of course the added bday note touch and candle \\n\\nDrinks:\\nThe spritz we got was pretty strong and I would say would carry over from app to dessert in terms of size  but no complaints!\\n\\nOnly downside was the space was quite dark by the time dinner arrived so I couldn't really SEE the dishes in much detail. The place was packed by the time we neared dessert. Great location and would come back!\", \"We liked it so much last time that we had to come again this time (different location though). We were quite surprised that we were able to get a same day reservation (8:45PM). I will have to say that I prefer the other location, the ambience feels a lot more homey. This one has more of a modern feel to it.\\n\\nThat aside, the food is just as good both times! The wine, bread, appetizer and desserts were also very yummy. Service was a bit slow at first, but it's really about finding the right waiter. Once we got ahold of one and let him know that we're in a slight rush, he was able to accommodate very well.\", \"The food and ambiance here has been amazing! I really liked how they decorated the atmosphere here and it really feels European like and sets up to be very romantic for a date. The service was very good. Our server, Irina, really knew her stuff. She gave good recommendations on some of the options to start and end with. \\n\\nI ordered the Fritto Misto, Filetto Di Manzo, and Affogato. The Fritto Misto although it was a fried dish, it was not as heavy as I thought it would be. The seasonings were not too salty and had just the right amount of balance. The Filetto Di Manzo was Amazing! It was extremely tender and presentable. It paired well with one of their red wines. Lastly the Affogato was so balanced! it wasn't too sweet or bitter and tasted just right. We had an amazing time here and the food was just amazing! I would come back here to try other things on their menu and would really recommend the Filetto Di Manzo!\", \"Wow, was this place amazing!  This was my first time going.  I had been invited by a friend and very much enjoyed the candlelit ambiance and decor.  For the appetizer, I ordered the Barbabietole salad, which is a roasted red beet salad with walnuts, goat cheese, and other items, drizzled with champaign vinaigrette.  Taste-wise, so refreshing and light.  Portion-wise, the salad was a meal in itself!  \\n\\nAfter, I went on to have an entree and am very glad I did.  I ordered the Ravioli Di Noci, which is ravioli with walnuts and cream sauce.  Portion-wise, it may not have looked like a lot (6-7 pieces), but for me, the portion size was just right, especially since I ate a salad before.  Taste-wise, omg!!!  It was delicious!  The pieces melted in my mouth.  \\n\\nLastly, we had dessert.  I ordered the Tortino di Cioccolato, which is chocolate walnut cake and salted caramel ice cream.  I liked it, but unfortunately, I was so full by this point that I wasn't able to finish!  Instead, I picked off of my friend's order of Affogato, which is two scoops of vanilla ice cream with espresso.  What I really liked about having an affogato to top things off was that it wasn't too sweet.  Something about the coffee with ice cream felt like a good finish.\\n\\nOverall, I had amazing food, ambiance and service (thank you, Irina, and the manager!).  \\n\\nWould highly recommend!\", 'We went to Da Andrea for a nice dinner. The inside is quite large, I love the bit of old-time, antique feel of the interior with the exposed brick wall, tile floor, and the chandeliers.\\n\\nWe Capri and Cocomero cocktails. They were both strong and very flavorful. We really enjoyed them both. \\n\\nFor Appetizer, we ordered Fritto Misto, and Tigelle Modenesi con ProsciuttoThey were both pretty large portions, much more than I thought they would be for appetizers. Fritto Misto came with avocado cream, an innovative accompaniment from the typical red sauce you see at other restaurants. It had loads and loads of calamari, with some shrimps and zucchini. It was delicious!\\n\\nThe prosciutto appetizer was great, really big portion. The hot tigelle, kind of like English muffins or flat bread made the perfect edible serving plate for the glorious prosciutto. Totally excellent and filling too.\\n\\nFor main, we ordered Zuppa Di Pesce and Stinco Di Agnello. Zuppa had a nice amount of spiciness with bold flavor with such depth. It had ample amount of seafood. It reminded me of Chioppino. The Lamb was so tender that it melt in your mouth. The meat just falls off the bone! Saffron rice was very good, with a great saffron flavor that went perfectly with the lamb.\\n\\nFor desserts, we ordered Tiramisu and Tortino di Mele. Tiramisu was soft and creamy, nice coffee flavor, just a simple, classic, delicious dessert. I say it was the perfect ending for the amazing dinner! The apple tart was nice and warm with great cinnamon flavor on soft and sweet apple. Tart was sturdy to hold them all in, but soft enough to crumble in your mouth. I really enjoyed this dessert!\\n\\nWe had an amazing time at the Da Andrea. Everything we tried, from the cocktails, the food, and the desserts, were all delicious! We got some food to take home with to enjoy them the next day, as the portion was quite large. We will definitely go back for more delicious dishes in the near future!', 'Service was awesome and loved the ambiance of the restaurant. Would recommend the Caesar salad and the tiramisu.', \"Lovely spot for a cute date night or dinner with friends. The restaurant is beautifully decorated from the inside out. My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night and the place was pretty packed, I'd recommend making a reservation.\\n\\nWe started off with a couple drinks, bread and olive oil, tuna tartare, and the mussels. For the mains we had the pappardelle pasta and pork chop. We finished the dinner with the tiramisu and panna cotta as well as a complimentary dessert. Everything was delicious but the standout dishes were the succulent pork chop and the pasta. \\n\\nThe staff were friendly and efficient throughout our dining experience. I would highly recommend this place if you're in the Chelsea area looking for Italian!\", 'Had an amazing time here last night. Came with a group of ten (booked a reservation in advance) and service was amazing! The food was delish and the drinks were constantly pouring. I really enjoyed my time here.

This is so fruity and light and my kind of drink. \\n\\n- Negroni: My brother got gin instead and he liked it \\n\\n- Fritto misto: I love calamari but I was kind of disappointed with this. It was fine and nothing special. I wish the pieces were crispier. It came with an avocado mayo sauce that was good.\\n\\n- Insalata tiepida di polipo: This was really good and better than the calamari. The warm octopus were in the perfect bit size pieces.\\n\\n- Spaghetti all carbonara: My brother really liked this and I had a few bites and can agree. It was creamy and had the perfect ratio of pasta to sauce.\\n\\n- Zucca di pesce: I love seafood so I was excited for this dish. It was a very generous mix of salmon, mussels, scallops, and shrimp.  \\n\\n- Affogato: I was so excited to have this beagle I love affogato. But I was disappointed with this. The coffee was biter and didn't add to the vanilla ice cream. I would pass on this. \\n\\n- Tortino di mele: This was super yummy and had the perfect ratio of ice cream to the apple tart. \\n\\nOverall, I had a fantastic experience and would love to come back to try some of the different dishes!\", 'Amazing meal with my family. We had server Kadir who went above and beyond! I recommend the truffle mashed potatoes.', \"Stepping into Da Andrea is like being transported to the Italian countryside, far from the chaos of the city.

Our server knew the menu inside and out, steering us toward dishes that didn't just satisfy--they hit hard. The man even poured us a few wines to taste, making sure we found the right bottle for the night. It's that kind of attention to detail that sets the great places apart from the merely good.\\n\\nNYC is overflowing with Italian joints- I've been to several this week already, popular ones too. Da Andrea is different. Homey flavors, homey portions. You won't find pretentious $40 ravioli dishes with four pieces; instead, the ROI is two-fold. The warm octopus--tender, perfectly seasoned. The lamb shank--fall-off-the-bone tender, served with saffron risotto that practically sings. And the mushroom ravioli? Pure bliss in every bite. The short rib pappardelle was a special, and it tasted like one too--rich, comforting, and utterly satisfying. Honorable mention goes to the Cavatelli di Ricotta and Tuna Tartare. \\n\\nThis isn't just another Italian restaurant owned by a corporate restauranteur. It's a place with two decades under its belt, where the kitchen knows exactly what it's doing and doesn't need to show off. They just deliver. If you've got a pulse and a taste for the good stuff, you'll want to make a reservation here. Bring your friends too so that you can eat family style.\", \"So glad that we picked this place to celebrate my sister's birthday dinner! Everyone was saying 10/10 all the way around. I agree.\\n\\nAt first, I was a little thrown off by the reservation process... having to give my credit card seems to be pretty standard nowadays, but since I booked it within a week and it said that any cancellations within a week would result in a fee, I was really hesitant to proceed. I decided to just take the chance and requested to not email my cc info, and was told that someone would call me to take my information, but they never did. But, they DID confirm my reservation... or so I thought. I am glad that I called the day of for some questions because they said they didn't have my reservation down?! I remained calm and I'm glad that I did because it was able to be confirmed over the phone. YIKES! Probably because summer Sundays in the city aren't the busiest, but just a heads up!\\n\\nThere was plenty of on street parking as well, which was such a gem. The place is beautiful inside and out. You actually feel like you're in Italy, with the rustic decor. Bathrooms were extremely clean. Service was perfect. Hi Sebastian! And the food.... oh the food. We opted for a pre fixe menu since we were a large party of 10, and the options didn't disappoint. I chose the squid salad with cucumber, spaghetti carborara, and for dessert.. I HIGHLY recommend the chocolate walnut cake with salted caramel ice cream. Everything was fresh and amazing. I love that there pasta wasn't super hard as I usually find in higher quality Italian restaurants... the portion sizes were perfect... and I'm not the biggest chocolate dessert fan, but that was some quality decadence! Cocktails were delicious... I ordered the fragoli spritz which was a winner.\\n\\nI'm looking for another reason to return!\", \"What a beautiful restaurant! The doors are adorned with flowers, and as soon as you step inside, it feels like you've entered an Italian villa, complete with rustic charm and lush greenery. \\n\\nOur server was exceptional, guiding us to the best dishes and helping us select the perfect wine. He even poured a few different wines for us to taste, ensuring we made the right choice.\\n\\nIn a city with countless Italian restaurants, this one stands out as one of my top picks. The food is simply exceptional--both straightforward and bursting with flavor. My favorites of the evening included the warm octopus, lamb shank, mushroom ravioli, and the special short rib pappardelle. The lamb shank was so tender it fell off the bone, perfectly complemented by saffron risotto. The ravioli was incredibly flavorful, delivering a heavenly taste with each bite.\\n\\nI highly recommend giving this place a try. With two decades in NYC, they clearly know their craft and excel at it.\", \"Amazing service from our waiter Kadir, he recommended us the best food and drinks. He's very nice and well informed, I always appreciate waiters that know the menu inside and out... the ambiance was perfect for a date night. We both enjoyed pasta and aesthetic cocktails. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. 6 stars from us!\", \"Walked into Da Andrea at 7:30 on a Friday night for my reservation, and it was FULLY packed. Perfect vibes. Bustling with plenty of happy groups (dates, birthday parties, catch-up dinners) but not obnoxiously loud. Beautiful greenery with sunlight flowing in.\\n\\nI was greeted by smiling faces and attentive servers with some bread and olive oil. My partner and I ordered a cocktail each, some raw appetizers, and some pasta. The tuna tartare was delicious. My partner and I liked both sauces it came with, and I only wish there was more endive.\\nThe carpaccio was topped with a delicious arugula salad with a lemony dressing that really prepped me for the unctuous pastas.\\nThe cappellacci was super filling and had a very satisfying truffle flavor.  The tagliolini caught my eye with the squid ink. The pasta texture was al dente and the clams were PERFECT.\\nThe sun set through our meal as we enjoyed our tiramisu and house-made limoncello. Tiramisu was delicious and not overly sweet. The limoncello was quite possibly the best I've ever had - sweet, floral, and pretty strong.\\nThis was genuinely a top tier date spot with great vibes, solid food, and solid drinks!\", \"Super happy that Da Andrea opened a 2nd location and much easier to get a reservation. Definitely more spacious and bigger bar than the original location. This is located on the west side... came here for dinner a little after month it opened for a birthday dinner :)    \\n\\nService was good and food just as good as Greenwich Village location. Recommend making reservations.\\n\\nMenu:  Plenty to choose from for drinks and food itself.  They do have specials as well...so additional options to consider.\\n\\nThe restaurant is dimly lit so may be a little hard to read the menus and may need light from your phones...\\n\\nComplimentary bread with olive oil to start. \\n\\nAppetizers: Had the burrata and veal meatballs. Surprisingly as a person who doesn't eat veal, the meatballs were good.  \\n\\nMain course: Ordered my usual and highly recommend the squid ink tagliolini (my favorite and go to dish) and the scallop special.  Both dishes were good.\\n\\nDessert: panna cotta (my fave and high recommend if you want something light) and the chocolate walnut cake with salted caramel ice cream (for the chocolate and caramel lovers). Complimentary biscotti. \\n\\nWill definitely be back again :)\", \"Food and the ambience was great. Service was very much attentive in which we like. Great for small parties but for our reservation of 5 people we was seated at the smallest table. We love the spot but didn't care to much for the seating arrangements. Restaurant is cute but not for more than 2 ppl per a table to be honest\", \"Stopped by at around four pm on a random Saturday.   Got sat at the bar pretty quickly but it took about fifteen minutes before anyone checked in on me/offered drinks, even though the restaurant  was pretty empty still.  Ordered the calamari fried platter, which came with fried shrimp and zucchini and avocado mayo. The mayo was quite good. The seafood was fried pretty well; it wasn't greasy and felt light.  That said, it was pretty underseasoned.  I had to salt it quite heavily and then it became quite good.  For entree, I got the squid ink pasta. The pasta was about a degree softer than perfect al dente, though the noodle itself was quite flavorful.  The clams were nice as well but the dish, like the calamari, was pretty underseasoned.  Also had to dowse it in salt to make it enjoyable.  Service was personable when they did come by but everything was just a tad too slow and had to flag them (at times thrice ) to get them to refill drinks/remember.  Vibe was intimate and beautiful, though!   At this price range, I would not recommend.\", \"Fabulous dinner with guests visiting from London. Beautifully decorated for the holidays and it was cozy and busy. We shared the Caesar salad, octopus, veal meatballs, shrimp cavatelli, pappardelle, veal ravioli and braised lamb shank. Everything was perfection. Not one dish to skip. Lamb shank with that saffron risotto is not to be missed. Can't wait to come back and try everything else. Perfect for out of towners and large groups.\", \"Da Andrea Chelsea is a hidden gem that stands out not only for its beautiful ambiance but also for its exceptional cuisine and great service. \\n\\nWe decided to share a variety of dishes, starting with the warm octopus and Caesar salad, followed by the squid ink pasta and Ricotta Cavatelli. Each dish was a culinary delight, bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. The warm octopus was tender and perfectly seasoned, while the Caesar salad offered a fresh and crisp start to our meal. The squid ink pasta was a standout with its rich and savory taste, and the Ricotta Cavatelli was creamy and comforting, a true testament to the chef's skill. \\n\\nWhat truly elevated our visit was the impeccable service. Our waiter, Kadir, went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable time. He was attentive without being intrusive, always making sure our water glasses were full and that we had everything we needed. Kadir's dedication to providing top-notch service was evident and greatly appreciated.\\n\\nIn summary, Da Andrea Chelsea is a must-visit for anyone seeking a combination of exquisite food, beautiful surroundings, and outstanding service. I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to returning soon.\\n\\n---\", 'Da Andrea is a beautiful space. The floral decor and facade is incredibly welcoming. The bar is off to the right of the main dining area which comfortably seats about 30 followed by an a smaller dining are which seems ideal for private events. \\n\\nOn the Sunday afternoon I visited, the main area is empty. Within 10 mins a large brunch party arrived and this is where things quickly went left. It was around 3:30 and apparently brunch ends at 4. However, there technical is no break in service or siesta, instead there\\'s just a menu switch. The 3 wait staff on the floor seemed immediately frazzled. The waitress rushed us to order only to have the incorrect meals show up at the table. \\n\\n\\nHe ordered the Salmone alla Griglia which has \\nGrilled Salmon, Charred Cauliflower, Cherry Tomatoes, Broccoli Rabe, Dijon Mustard Sauce but received the Salmone Affimicato which is \\nFresh baked \"Tigelle\" Buns, Smoked Salmon, Capers, Onions, Scallion Cream Cheese. \\n\\nI had the Insalata Di Pera which has Poached Pear, Arugula, Gorgonzola, Walnuts, Honey Mustard. I asked for the walnuts to be removed ( alergies). The salad came out with 2 thinly sliced pieces of pear and the tiniest sprinkling of Gorgonzola. I could have had a better salad at Pret Manger or Cosi. Overall underwhelming. \\n\\nThe wait staff stood around awkwardly steering at us every couple odd seconds so I was forced do ask if they were waiting for us to leave, he said no. \\nHowever, the behaviors didn\\'t but I asked for the check and we left. \\n\\nWhere did we go? To get food elsewhere. \\n\\nEven after the mixup with the food, I was open to retuning but based on the wait staff\\'s behavior- the only thing I\\'d do is enroll them in cultural sensitivity training.', \"So happy we decided to come here for dinner before heading up to see & Juliet! To start, I love the front of the restaurant. It so beautiful!  From the bread, to the apps, dinner, drinks, and dessert... all outstanding! One of the best espresso. martinis I've ever had. Service was amazing. The Christmas vibe in this restaurant really sets the tone for the holidays!\", 'Wonderful pasta selection. Had the carbonara and ravioli, and steak. What a meal. Our table was not big enough. Service was great despite all the big groups having holiday dinners.', \"The food was amazing, portion size was just perfect for Italian. We didn't  walk out super full and they brought out some little biscotti with a lemon cream dipping sauce since we opted not to do dessert. Tables are a little close together so you feel like you are eating with everyone but overall nice atmosphere.\", \"Came here with a friend after spending a fun day in the city and so glad we did. Recently opened (December 2023) when this use to be a Mexican restaurant. Friendly service. The ambiance is great for friends dinning, date night or a group gathering. The food is delicious and we both ended up ordering the grilled lamb chop special, which did not disappoint. Perfectly grilled (medium rare), excellently seasoned and the Dijon mustard really makes the flavors come together so beautifully. This was accompanied by fresh sauteed spinach (delicious!) and baby potatoes. A must order if you are a lamb fan. \\nSaved room for dessert and ordered their gelato - dark chocolate, vanilla and sea salt caramel. Wonderful creamy and rich consistency and when it melted, it's a symphony of delicious contrasting and complimentary flavors. \\n\\nWill come back!\", \"Celebrated and early birthday in New York with my best friends and we decided to have dinner at De Andrea during our stay in Chelsea. The dinner and ambiance were both amazing. I love Italian but went away from my usual pasta choices and decided on the lamb chops special instead... what a great choice. They were tender and cooked to perfection. They were also laid atop of a bed of potatoes (my favorite) and spinach. My friends shared the sliced steak platter and I'm convinced they had the mead sweats later because they ate every bit of it declaring how tasty it was with each bite. The truffle ravioli had a melt in your mouth flavor and my friends paired it with the steak which was another great choice that they made. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in the Chelsea area. Our waiter was kind and very knowledgeable about the menu as well.\", \"Pretty good pasta, for a pretty okay price! Da Andrea's Chelsea location was a nice dining experience, with good food and excellent service.\\n\\nThe pasta dishes were both delicious -- the pasta was mostly al dente, and the sauces/squid ink added lots of flavor.\\n\\nServers were friendly and very prompt, really on top of their game here.\\n\\nThe interior was nice, though tables are pretty crowded, so expect to sit elbow to elbow at most tables.\\n\\nOverall, a solid dining experience, and the bill wasn't too bad in the end.

My mom was visiting from out of town and Amelie is one of my favorite spots, so I was excited to bring her.  About an hour before our reservation, my 4 cousins called me and asked if they could also join, which I didn\\'t think would be an issue as they would also be eating and drinking.  I called Amelie to give a heads up about the additional people and no one answered the phone.  We showed up about 20 min early to the reservation to explain the situation, and begrudgingly and with a bad attitude, were told it would be figured out.\\n\\nOnce we had sat down, one of the staff members came to our table, and asked who had made the reservation.  It was under my name, and I said I had.  In front of the rest of the table he rudely said \"Next time, make the reservation for the correct amount of people\" and walked away.

We spent over $500 and we\\'re rushed the entire time (our waiter was lovely and he was not the one treating us poorly).\\n\\nThere was no body else waiting for our table, and this entire experience honestly made me never want to return to Amelie.

The vibes are great- very aesthetically pleasing with good music and attentive service. They offer a wide selection of wines and have a great happy hour- inclusive of exploratory wine flights. If you are coming for dinner, I recommend the mussels. They are *chefs kiss*.  Great for a date, happy hour, or catching up with the gals.\", 'Dirty, Disgusting and SO RUDE. We asked a couple questions about the menu and our waiter was so put out and nasty towards us. We had a direct view of the kitchen and it looked pretty grungy and our concerns of health/safety were confirmed when we found a hair in our fries.

I mean the flights were pretty mid but $14 for 3 glasses, how could I ever complain?\\n\\nTo pair with our flights, we got the truffle fries because fries and wine combination is undefeated. Fellas, put a hinge prompt that your simple pleasures include \"fries and wine\" and watch the likes roll in. Free game.\\n\\nAmélie is about as French as a French restaurant gets. The waiter had a heavy French accent, the receipt came in a book written in French, fries were BOMB, plates of escargots flying in and out of the kitchen, and the service was meh.\\n\\nMy big bro also went on the first date with his wife here the other night, so this place is pretty special. \\n\\nIg @jnov_\\nTiktok @jnov_reviews', 'Service was great , knowledgeable.

None of the three were that great. They tasted average/cheap. The flavors lacked complexity. They just didn't hit. \\n\\nI also ordered the escargot. This was my first time trying snails. They were okay. I had looked at photos of the appetizer on Yelp, and from the photos I thought that there would be a lot more sauce for dipping bread into--but there really wasn't extra sauce  \\n\\nThe dipping bread was good but they didn't give any oil or butter with it. \\n\\nMy friend got a glass of red wine, it was a large glass and heavy pour so I'd recommend that over a flight. \\nShe also got a salad and asked for grilled salmon and the waiter repeated that back. Yet, the salad came with smoked salmon (lox) and then they said that they couldn't change it. \\n\\nIt was also restaurant week but I didn't like the entree options: raviolis, branzino, or an extra $8 for steak?

We shared the Brussel sprouts (9/10 nice and crispy!) and she ordered the burger with truffle fries (8/10 for the fries I've had better truffle fries).

Delicious wines, adorable fun ambiance.', \"A cute spot in West Village with good vibes. Maybe bc it's a wine bar, by default it gives summer in a la France. The wine, however, does not give Francé as much. While good, the wines within each flight are incredibly similar, which I think slightly defeats the purpose, to each their own. We got the Matthieu, Reda, and Jules (ranked in order of preference). Matthieu is the most different; the others basically taste the same lmao. Food was good, I liked the branzino more than the scallops. Salmon tartare was good / fine. The peach dessert (peche Melba) was actually very yum!

My top two dishes on their menu have to be the escargot and the coq au vin, but I recently had the chance to try their duck confit, the chèvre chaud (a must if you're into charred goat cheese), and baked Camembert. All of the dishes were absolutely phenomenal. \\n\\nAt the end of our meal, we called and audible and got the crepes Suzette, which was a wonderful, warm, gooey, citrusy treat at the end of the meal. \\n\\nI love this spot, and I'll always find a reason to come back.\", \"5 for Amelie's happy hour! Their happy hour lasts until 7pm (6pm on Fridays and Saturdays), and it features assorted wine/wine flights/beer/cocktails and a select few food items. I ordered the Olivier wine flight (the sparkling flight) and the Warm Pistachio Goat Cheese Ball. \\n\\nThe wine flight came with 3 glasses - Prosecco, rosé, and champagne, and each had a generous pour. Great value for the $13 HH price. All 3 had good flavors and leaned toward the drier side. The goat cheese ball ($10 during HH) was sooo good with onion and honey flavors, and it paired great with the wines.\\n\\nI highly recommend making a reservation or getting there early because they were extremely busy (even on a Wednesday evening). It's well worth the effort, as the happy hour is a can't miss!\", 'We came here for brunch and decided to eat outside on a Sunday. The outside seating in front of the restaurant then the street outdoor dining. Inside was nice, and this is a good spot for a friend brunch or dinner. \\n\\nBrunch was great! We ordered the escargot, croque madame, and pistachio brûlée. Everything was great. \\n\\nService was okay, multiple people around us were complaining about them not checking in on them and the food arriving out of order and I would agree. Food was good though.', \"I ate here back in 2014 and I remember how great it was!  I don't work around this area anymore, but if I were hungry and near the restaurant I'd eat here again.  The prices are reasonable.  Good service and friendly staff.  I ate here 10 years ago, this review is based on food that I ate 10 years ago, and I still remember it.  Very French bistro vibes.  Yes, I've eaten at French bistros in France.  I can write that!  I've eaten many things in France.  I've flown to France just to eat a meal.  Traveled to Belgium just to eat chocolates and waffles.\", 'Came here for dinner with the family after a day of touring. Food was delicious but wished there was kids menu.', \"I've been coming to this place for the past 6 years and it remains one of the best deals in the city and a space super special to me. Amelie is a super cute little French restaurant and bar around the corner from Washington Square Park. It's a great spot to meet people coming in from Jersey City, if you're in the city or Brooklyn - and it's an even better place to take a date! The atmosphere is kinda romantic with dim lighting and nice music. They also have a good range of outdoor dining, which is great for those covid conscious or if you want to enjoy the nice weather. The food is really great. Not sure what they do to their bread but it's phenomenal. I definitely recommend the cheese board if you're looking for high quality food and bites. Last but not least, the wine is phenomenal. Their happy hour deals are a steal and truly is the best deal in the city.\", \"I came here on a Friday evening for dinner. It was before 6pm so we got to enjoy happy hour. Your get a 3 wine flight for $13 which is an amazing deal. \\nFor my entree I had the coq au vin.

Of these, I'd recommend the soup and the salad. The mussels are a nice light, inoffensive shareable thing with a sophisticated aftertaste in a homey pot. \\n\\nDessert\\nCreme brûlée was great.

Came here for lunch and ordered items mostly from their seasonal specials menu (ending on new years). Got the Xiao XingXing (dumplings), Had Yai Chicken, Soi Dao, and Persimmon Masaman Curry. The dumplings were delicious and had a nice meaty filling. The chicken had a perfectly crispy skin and was juicy and delicious with the sweet chili sauce. I really like the Soi Dao which had squid ink noodles. It was flavorful with just the right amount of heat and nice chunks of crab meat. The curry was a bit too sweet for me. For dessert, we got the Thai Choux which also came with a scoop of Thai ice cream. This was super good and totally worth the $16. \\n\\nService was attentive and very helpful in suggesting what to order.

Safe to say it was worth the hype and that Michelin guide four years straight! We managed to snatch a reservation like two weeks ahead. I heard you can walk in but be prepared to wait.\\n\\nThe servers are very friendly and attentive. You will walk into a pretty yet unpretentious space with overall great ambiance. My partner and I got moo dang puff and gyo pla (fish dumplings) to share. I also got myself nam tok moo. We might have ordered a little too much but everything was phenomenal. Moo dang puff has a crispy pastry (a little oily in my opinion) and well seasoned filling. I really loved gyo pla - it has an interesting texture and well balanced taste! Nam tok was the best nam tok I have ever tried so far in the states!!\\n\\nThey have an interesting drink menu based of gems and I know they are also well-known for their drinks but I didn't get to try them this time sadly.\\n\\nI will definitely go back for more!\\n\\n-8.7/10\", \"Best Thai food we've ever had  Entrees are ~$25 and there are nooo misses!

All of it was sooo good, would get everything again except maybe the mango sticky rice (it was good but not super special). Resys are so hard though so look early! \\n\\nInstagram - @joangela.eats\", \"We had a reservation for a Saturday at 6pm.  Restaurant was packed and seating in general tends to be a little cramped here so I was anxious.  They offer coat check at the entrance to help mitigate that - a considerate touch, but I noticed most patrons decided to keep their coats with them.  We were seated at a table in the back room which I never knew existed until that point (my first two visits were at the bar and a corner table by the front window) It provided the most spacious seating arrangements in the house and we were happy to be seated against the wall. Heating lamps above set to 73 degrees kept us comfortable. \\n\\nWe placed orders for drinks and food. Both emerged within no more than 5 minutes.  Had Yai Chicken and Yum Kaw Moo to start. The chicken (2 drumsticks and a thigh sliced neatly in half - clean through bone) arrived steaming and fall-off-the-bone. Tendons removed from the drumsticks. They're a low carb-delight: deep-fried sans batter. The grilled pork salad was a perfect combination of sweet, spicy and sour with a hint of salinity. A carnivore's dream given the only vegetables in sight were of the herbal variety.  The lime dressing was so good I used it on the fried chicken. \\n\\nThe mains arrived next: The Panang Duck Lychee Curry was nice but the star of the show was the Crab Fried Rice.  To be clear: it was the fried rice portion they perfected. Tastes like it came from a 7-star hotel.  Such a centerpiece I decided to box it to go as soon as the full-meter hit a comfortable 8/10 because I didn't want the discomfort of stuffing myself to detract from my enjoyment of it. Also because I was reserving space for dessert. \\n\\nWe ended the meal with the Seasonal Thai Choux. Wonderful presentation with an enjoyable range of flavors and textures. I enjoyed the buttery aroma from the choux but my favorite part was the chewy mouthfeel of the Thai tea gelato gently interrupted by crunchy cacao crumbles.\", \"Been wanting to try soothr for awhile. Made reservations for Sunday night at 6pm. I def recommend making a reservation since it's packed and they are also taking a lot of door dash/to go orders. We were sat within 10 mins of our reservation.\\n\\nWe ordered two cocktails (all that jade and aqua marine), duck rolls as an app, the panang duck lychee curry and beef pad so-iw. Our food was absolutely amazing. The rich and creaminess of the duck and curry with the lychee in it was next level. The noodles were perfectly flavored and soft and the duck rolls were crispy with a nice tangy sauce. \\n\\nI wanna go back and try more! My jade drink was not as tasty but that can happen with matcha sometimes. \\n\\nThe waiters were attentive but gotta catch them when you can cause they're busy busy.\", \"I really enjoyed our night out at Soothr. It was quite packed and lively, so we made a reservation in advance to secure a table for five. The restaurant was bustling, with lots of white noise from the surrounding tables, which added to the vibrant atmosphere.\\n\\nThat said, the space felt a bit tight--our table for five was essentially a table for four with an extra chair pulled up at the edge. I felt a little bad for my friend who had to sit there.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was great overall. I especially loved the chive cake--it was soft, tender, and still had a nice crispness. This was my second visit to Soothr, and while my first visit set the bar pretty high, this time the other dishes were just okay. They weren't bad, but maybe my memory hyped them up too much.\\n\\nOverall, it was still a good experience, and I'd definitely recommend it. If your group is into cocktails, their drink menu looked really intriguing.\", \"Food: 4/5\\nyummmm!!! Food here was really good and I got to try something o wouldn't normally gravitate towards thanks to the recommendation of our server. I ordered the Karee Pu Noodles and loved them! I did get a side of chili sauce to add because I love spicy, and that made the dish extra good. The amount of crab that comes with this is fairly decent and I liked the thin spaghetti like style of the noodles. Also had the duck rolls with wood ear mushrooms which were very good! I have to say Thai I've had in queens has been better, but I've enjoyed this meal!\\n\\nAtmosphere for date: 4/5 \\nI loved the atmosphere inside the restaurant, just keep in mind tables are all very close together! I would not recommend eating here if you are a larger person (even for me squeezing in between tables was hard and I'm only 5'3) I don't think it would be very comfy if you are looking for more spacious seating/ have a large group. They do have a coat check which is helpful but it's tight quarter inside. Think this would be a nice date place if you wanna be near someone and it wasn't too loud to talk / although not super quiet either. Definitely a hustle / bustle about the place. \\n\\nService: 3.5/5\\nFor a really nice restaurant the service is good, but they are so busy they don't seem to have time to explain the menu in depth, etc. maybe this just isn't part of the experience but I wouldn't say the service stood out in any way. It wasn't bad, but just typical of most restaurants.\", 'I did a walk in for two when the restaurant opened and they said the wait will be 45 minutes, but I got the text from them after 20 mins. \\n\\nI would recommend getting the Ba Mii Pu, which is dry crab noodles with a spicy Tom Yum thick broth and the Khao Soi Sai Ua, which is crispy egg noodles with northern Thailand curry. \\n\\nIt lives up to the hype but not sure if I would wait more than an hour for seats.', 'I mean there are truly no words for how amazing this meal was!!!! Great service, great ambience \\n\\nWe went with what the server recommended and it did not disappoint', \"Nestled in the heart of New York City, Soothr offers a dining experience that's as rich and inviting as the flavors of its Thai cuisine. From the moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the restaurant's authentically designed interior. You feel as though you've been transported directly into the side streets of Thailand. \\n\\nThe cocktail menu is a masterpiece in itself, but one drink stood out above the rest: the River's Topaz.  The cocktail delivers a captivating smoky profile, delicately enhanced by the bold aromatics of star anise and cinnamon. Each sip evokes an air of intrigue, as though you've stepped into the world of a James Bond film--mysterious, sophisticated, and undeniably alluring. The smoky essence lingers like a well-kept secret, while the warm spice notes dance on the palate, adding a complexity that keeps you coming back for more. It's a drink that feels as much an experience as it is a flavor, perfect for those who enjoy a touch of drama in their glass.\\n\\nMoving on to the food, Soothr truly excels at showcasing the depth and complexity of Thai cuisine. The Ba Mii Lobster Claw was the star of the night--each bite bursting with the rich, aromatic flavors of Thai curry. The dish is a perfect marriage of succulent lobster and perfectly cooked noodles, creating a harmony that lingers on the palate.\\n\\nAnother standout was the Ba Mii Pu, a noodle dish that left me equally impressed. The delicate sweetness of the crab paired with the savory seasoning was pure magic, delivering an experience that felt indulgent yet comforting.  I could go on and on about the exceptional dishes and the thoughtful details that make Soothr so special, but I'll leave the rest as a pleasant surprise for you to discover. Trust me, it's an experience worth savoring...run, don't walk to Soothr!\", 'Tried Soothr for the first time bc everyone raves about it and the aesthetic did not disappoint. We got a table seated right by the door and this restaurant was extremely cramped. Your whole party also has to be there before seated. Definitely not ideal for large groups and it felt really stuffy because all the staff, customers, and tables inside. \\n\\nWe ordered the crab fried rice, duck noodles, pad see eew, and the koong karee. The koong karee was amazing and soo flavorful. The food was great and well seasoned however the portions were definitely A LOT smaller than most places.', 'The food waa amazing. My girlfriend had the beef pad thai and I ordered the khao soi which i recommend. The real star of the show was their appetizer, yum neur. The service was quick even though it was busy. And the ambiance of the place was nicely decorated to fit their Thai esthetic.', 'Delicious food! \\n\\nWe ordered the Moo Dang Puff, Koong Karee, Duck Noodles, and the Amethyst Drink. Everything was excellent. My favorites were the duck noodles and the moo dang puff. All of the dishes were flavorful and came out quickly. \\n\\nThe service is fast though it can get quite loud. A very bustling atmosphere. \\n\\nOverall, I will definitely be returning!', 'I finally got to try Soothr and understand why many deem this restaurant as their favorite in NYC. I was able to get a resy that I booked on a whim a couple of weeks in advance and was so glad I was able to visit! \\n\\nNotable favs of the night were the seafood tom yum hotpot and the karee pu noodles. Very authentic flavors and tons of seafood/crab in the dish! I typically dont loove tom yum hotpot but this one was very well balanced without having a super overpowering lemongrass flavor. We also got the green curry nuer toon, which had a nice kick and had plenty of beef to share amongst the four of us. Definitely do family style so you can share a bit of everything. \\n\\nThe cocktails were also delicious and pretty strong. I got the rose quartz which tasted just as good as it looked. Will def be back and would def recommend visiting here if youre in NYC.', 'Food: 4\\nDecor: 4\\nService: 4\\n\\nCame here for lunch after booking a res a few days in advance.

Tasty and better than the koong karee. The lychee added a nice amount of acid and sweetness to the curry, and the duck was cooked nicely. \\n\\nService was solid.', 'This place has a lot of hype so it is definitely better to make a reservation before coming. They have nice ambiance and very cute decor - I liked cute plates and glasses. Unfortunately, the service is not friendly at all, do not expect to see smiling waiters. Our server was rushing us to place an order, and to eat - maybe because it was a Friday night and he wanted to turn table quickly, but it was not an enjoyable experience. We ordered a lot of food - on a nice note, the food arrived quickly, but the waiter did not really care to check on us to make sure we were doing okay. I love Thai cuisine but this place was just ok, nothing special. Most of the dishes were too sweet, the only dish that I really enjoyed was the crab fried rice, the rest is not worth mentioning.', 'So so delicious!!! Our favorite was definitely the Koong Karee. The creamy egg curry was a perfect texture and there was a good number of shrimp! The duck noodles were also great but the portion was small for the price. The drinks were delicious too and the desserts were a perfect way to end the meal. The only thing that was a bit subpar was the dumplings. Pretty steep price for 4 little dumplings. But overall, would recommend! The waitstaff were also so patient with us and answered all of our questions. The interior was small but decorated beautifully. Make a reservation beforehand!', 'I had a delivery order from Soothr.\\n\\nIt consisted of Koong Karee, Penang Duck Lychee Curry and Plum Za.\\n\\nThe Koong Karee shrimp was under cooked and kind of tasteless. The sauce was ok. \\nThe duck in the Panang Duck Lychee Curry  was too fatty, and a little undercooked. I realize duck is a fatty dish, and that you want a little pink inside. I think this was too much of each. The sauce and rice were good. The lychee in the dish are delicious. \\n\\nPlum Za is a unique plum drink, a little on the pungent side, unique with a strong taste.\\n\\nPacking was good, and very fast, perhaps a little too fast. It was the end of lunch time, and perhaps, they rushed the cooking of my food.\\n\\nRecommended with some reservations. \\nI will try it again.', 'The Khao Soi Sai Ua was incredible! The vibe of the place was fun and it smelled amazing the second you walk in. I want to go back and try so many things!\\n\\nSuch a fun vibe to go and hang with friends!', \"I finally scored a reservation at this Michelin-starred gem! On a chilly Sunday afternoon, my partner and I indulged in a fantastic lunch. Despite a 10-minute wait, the packed restaurant was worth it.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and attentive, helping us navigate the menu. We shared three creative cocktails (Pearl, Amethyst, and Dara Citrine) and a beer, which arrived in an adorable bottle. The cocktails stole the show!\\n\\nFor starters, the Gyo Pla and Yum Nuer were exceptional, bursting with flavor. For our main course, we got a bit carried away and ordered two entrees - the portion sizes were generous, to say the least! The Kung Karee and Khao Soi-Si Ua both showcased rich coconut flavors that we adored.\\n\\nThis hearty meal was perfect for a cold winter's day. We'll definitely recommend this spot to friends and family!\", \"Came as a group of 6 as walk in on a Fri night and had to wait ~35 min for our table. We were seated by 7pm + had a very nice meal here! The restaurant is narrow, but quite deep. It gets pretty crowded, so you do have a dining limit. I'd hate to eat on the street / outdoor dining, as the sidewalk is pretty narrow and people walk right along side you. \\n\\nOur party did family style, so that we could try a bit of everything, which was all SO GOOD!! Their Chicken Khao Soi and Stewed Beef and Roasted Vegetable Masamun Curry are both MUST HAVES!! None are spicy at all and each of the dishes were really tasty. Their Duck Noodles are nothing special, however the Panang Duck Lychee Curry was quite good! The dishes are definitely more on the savory end, but everything was delicious, nonetheless. \\n\\nThe food came out pretty quick and the service was fantastic! We sat by the restrooms, so it got a bit crowded, but the food makes up for it. Decent overall dining experience that lives up to the reviews!\", \"Sometimes I am quite skeptical of restaurants for their hype and popularity due to being on the Michelin guide, but I stand corrected with this one. I can easily see why Soothr is one of the highest rated Thai restaurants in New York. It combines tradition and innovation with their dishes that really shine on flavor.\\n\\nOf course reservations are difficult to get here and there will be a wait if you walk-in, but I managed to get a reservation 2 days before at 5:30pm. Your best bet is coming at opening or closing times, but well worth it. Once we checked in, we were seated right away, so reservations are highly recommended.\\n\\nTo start off, I had the All That Jade ($18) cocktail. This was light and refreshing, though I wouldn't have been able to pinpoint flavors if I didn't read the ingredients. All of their cocktails are stone-inspired and all so pretty though. Nice way to start off the meal. \\n\\nFor food, the 3 of us shared the Had Yai Fried Chicken ($13), Kung Karee ($25), Duck Noodles ($25), and Tom Yum Seafood Hot Pot ($27). Everything we ordered was delicious, but the Kung Karee was easily the favorite of the night. This is a shrimp curry that has a thick sauce to perfectly pair with some white rice. But really, this curry could go on noodles, bread, anything. It combines well balanced flavors that is savory and spicy. Absolutely must get for anyone who dines here. That's one dish I'll reminisce about; can't wait to come back and try more dishes though.\", \"I'd recommend skipping the special menu items unless you come here often, because it can be a hit or miss. On their regular menu, the sukhothai noodle soup, Hoi Johr, and grilled pork salad are great. Service is quick and attentive as well. \\n\\nI was feeling adventurous and also tried a special menu noodle that I forgot the name of. It has shrimp, fish balls, and cuttlefish. The soup base tasted like a sweet chilli sauce I use at home and the cuttlefish was hard and flavorless, like it was boiled in water and thrown on top of the noodles.\", \"Soothr has a new plant forward menu and they have a couple more new veggie items to look forward to! We got a last min reservation and ordered the eggplant buns, La Plum soda, stir fry eggplant with soy sheets, and massaman curry vegetable trio. \\n\\nBoth entrees came with rice and were both delicious. The new veggie menu is definitely eggplant forward so look forward to that, but it's done well. The massaman curry was definitely the highlight, putting Soothr on the Michelin map, definitely come by for the curry.\", \"While considered one of the great NYC Thai establishments, the experience fails to deliver the knockout blow necessary to launch Soothr into a spot with the greats. \\n\\nThe Duck rolls were dominated by the leek and wood war mushrooms, plainly average. The crab fried rice, Kong Karee, Chicken Ki Mao, and Beef Pad Si-iw were all a touch above avergae. I will add that service was undeniably prompt and efficient, and the atmosphere is fresh and transports you to a retro Thai diner. \\n\\nHere's my takeaway: authenticity alone cannot make up for mediocre cooking. Average food peaks its ugly head from behind a Michellin guide label, $20 tapas plates, and dishes that most customers wouldn't understand. A fun experience sure, a repeat go-to for to quench upscale Thai cravings? No.\", 'Definitely a very popular Thai spot in the city from what I\\'ve seen on social media! Would highly recommend getting a reservation if you can because it was very busy/crowded when we went. And very worth it in my opinion! \\n\\nFor appetizers, we got: \\n- Moo Dang Puff: a puff pastry filled with pork, it was definitely my favorite appetizer.\\n- Duck Rolls: basically an egg roll with the a duck filling! This was very tasty as well!\\n- Yum Kaw Moo: grilled pork salad with a bunch of herbs. I was surprised by how much I liked this and would recommend trying it!\\n\\nFor entrees: \\n- Stewed beef noodle soup: this was decent. Very similar to pho and very flavorful, but I don\\'t know if I would get this again. \\n- Roasted pork over rice: this was delicious and very filling. It came with a small side of clear soup which was very refreshing. \\n\\nThey also have more \"traditional\" Thai items such as pad Thai and pad see ew. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the mango sundae (like mango sticky rice with ice cream) and the lychee rose sorbet. I\\'m not sure I would get the sorbet again, we had originally wanted the pung cha which has a Thai tea gelato and sweet sticky rice, but they had sold out. Mango sundae was delicious though!', \"I came here with a party of 8 for my brother's birthday dinner. We did have to make the reservation in advance via Resy.\\n\\nThe service was amazing. Our server was attentive.\\n\\nThe food is amazing! One of my favorite Thai restaurants in NYC! The drink cocktails here are also very well crafted. \\n\\nWill come back for sure!\", \"You HAVE to get the chicken khao soi here! I have been here several times and every time I don't get the chicken khao soi, I regret it. The chicken is service bone in, but the sauce it's served in and the crispy noodles here is such a fresh take on a classic, traditional dish. I have also had almost every jewel-themed cocktail on the menu and have never had anything to complain about. There is a bit of a wait, but the service is good and they will coat check for you. I love sitting in the back room-- the decor is super interesting and I love the vibes here as well.\", 'Ok, so I teetered between 4 and 5 stars. But the woman at the front door just seemed to not like people and honestly almost ruined the vibe. But once you get past her (both literally and figuratively) a fantastic dining awaits. Our waiter was kind. The food was phenomenal. The space is just tight. Like I could use an additional 6\" of room in all directions and that would legit help everything from dining to bathroom usage. We ordered based on our waiter\\'s recommendations and he did NOT steer us wrong. Make a reservation and be on time... Hell, early. And enjoy.', \"Overall, this is a great beginner-friendly Thai restaurant! We got several curries and the duck noodles. All the dishes were great, but definitely lower on the spice levels and on the sweeter side.\\n\\n- Duck curry: 9/10 (my personal favorite dish-- the duck was cooked well and the curry was great, but on the sweeter side.)\\n- Green curry with beef: 9/10 (loved the curry-- it wasn't as sweet as the other curries and a bit spicier (in a good way). The beef was a bit hard to chew on though.)\\n- Koong Karee: 8.5/10 (pretty good curry, but not my personal favorite dish)\\n- Duck noodles: 8.5/10 (decent noodles. This was definitely the sweetest dish out of all the dishes we ordered!)\\n\\nService was good, ambiance was great. Will be back to try out their other dishes!\", \"Really good restaurant but a little overhyped in my opinion. The restaurant is jam packed and the menu is on QR codes that are hard to open since theres like no cell service in the back.\\n\\nMy friend and i each got the amethyst drink and enjoyed those!\\n\\nFor food we shared the jeeb dumplings (8/10 really filled dumplings and the sauce was great but I feel like the sauce carried most of the flavor)\\n\\nHad yai chicken (10/10 delicious and juice, this was my favorite part of the meal!)\\n\\nKoong karee (7/10 it was good but I was expecting way more flavor for the hype this got. Also the shrimp tails were annoying)\\n\\nMango sundae (9/10)\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed my time here but I don't need to fight for a reservation and come back anytime soon.\", 'I doordashed the duck lychee curry, and while I am aware that you cannot truly experience a restaurant when you order delivery, this was severely lacking. There was barely one cup of liquid in the container, the duck was not flavourful, and the lychees seemed like an afterthought. It almost looks like they spilled half of the dish before putting it in the bowl. This could very well be a fluke and I am sure dining in person is a much better experience.', \"I've visited this in rebel Thai restaurant twice now and haven't been disappointed by their drinks, food, or service. The drinks were strong, innovative (gem themed), and delicious. The food was decadent (I've tried the roasted duck and crab fried rice) with reasonable portions for the high-end prices. The service was always friendly, with my waiter always being upbeat and smiling brightly!\\n\\nWould come again and introduce more visiting NYC friends for sure!\", \"Best Thai food ever!! The atmosphere was perfect for a date or girl's night & although seating was a little crowded it wasn't a problem for us. The cocktails are beautifully crafted & I really enjoyed my drink (Rose Quartz) although it was a little sweeter than my usual taste. The Soothr Jeeb dumplings were delicious!! They were super flavorful and I loved the spicy soy vinaigrette we dipped them in. The noodles were also amazing. The beef pad si-iw was simply delicious. I'll be dreaming of the thick noddles with the tender beef. Also really enjoyed the shrimp pad thai! The rice noodles were super seasoned and there was ample shrimp in the dish. Service was fast and I definitely want to come back to try more of their dishes\", \"I've been on Thai food craving of sorts lately and had to give Soothr a try!  This place is pretty popular and busy so a reservation is a must for this restaurant.  Would say the prices are a bit higher than average for their food.  Regardless, I would recommend this place for others to try at least once!\\n\\nAmbiance - 4/5 - Great vibes but the overall space is pretty tight\\n\\nRoasted Pork Over Rice - 4.5/5 - Roasted pork and pork sausage over rice with their honey BBQ gravy was delicious but had to take off half a star since it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Overall, still a great dish!\\n\\nMoo Dang Puff - 4/5 - Love thai curry puffs, but wasn't super in love with the roasted pork instead of the traditional potato filling\\n\\nYum Nuer - 5/5 - great refreshing beef salad packed full of flavor\", 'Located in the EV, Soothr offers Thai staples where you can enjoy a comforting meal.\\n\\n*AMBIANCE*\\nWe made a reservation here which is highly recommended.  They do take walk ins though you may have a short wait. This is a fairly small restaurant and tables are really tight. I almost felt like I was going to knock over some things from the table next to me as I was getting up and scooting out of my chair!  Not sure if it was just weak AC or the crowds of the restaurant, but it was a bit warm and toasty inside on a 90+ degree day, so the overall ambiance could be improved.\\n\\n*FOOD*\\nDespite the arms-length seating arrangements, the food here is tasty. Highly recommend the Koong Karee ($25) which is their signature shrimp curry dish!  It comes with a side of rice, but sauce is simply delicious and comforting.  \\n\\nThe duck noodles ($25) were also a favorite and very flavorful. The duck was chewy and egg noodles were very tender, drizzled with a house gravy sauce.\\n\\nWe also tried the Thai iced tea ($7) which I thought was just okay but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n*SERVICE*\\nService came quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nOverall, would recommend trying this Thai spot at least once!', \"As others have said, the Tom Yum soup is spectacular and always makes me return here when visiting NYC. The restaurant is cozy and welcoming. I'd highly recommend making a reservation as seating can be limited.\", \"Best duck noodles!\\n\\nWent here with a big group and got to try a lot of dishes, which were so good! My favorites were definitely the duck noodles and the chicken curry. The fried chicken was lacking and it's the only dish I would not get again. \\n\\nThe service was also very good and the waiters kept our waters filled and answered all our questions. \\n\\nOne tip I have is to check the menu ahead of time because there are so many items on the menu and they're more unique than your standard Thai menu, so it's worth it to have a game plan going in to avoid getting overwhelmed.\", 'Amazing food. You have to book early to get a reservation as it is a very popular spot. You will not be seated until your whole part arrives. Also we were constantly reminded of the time limit. They will tell you that the time beings when you are seated. And at the end of the meal, they hinted that we needed to leave. I love the food but I did feel rushed. Anyways for food I had the Tom yam noodle soup. Cocktails were good too.', \"Ooooooh, boy! Let me tell ya, folks... Honestly, I wasn't the biggest fan. Don't get me wrong, the food was good--I mean, I had the northern curry chicken, and it was yummy-yum-yum! But, funny enough, it was even better the next day as leftovers. Like, who knew? The eggrolls? Oh, they were tasty, for sure, but, uh, nothing super-duper special about them.\\n\\nNow here's where it gets... meh. The place was PACKED. I'm talkin' sardines-in-a-can packed. The food came out lightning-fast (like ZOOM!), which was cool, but the service? Eh, it was just... there. The server did their job--nothing fancy, no pizzazz. I only ended up there because we managed to snag a last-minute reservation--probably 'cause someone bailed last second.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad they've got the efficiency thing down, but as far as places I'd go back to? Ehhhhhh, probably not high on the list. But hey, at least I got some pretty decent leftovers out of it! Hehehe!\", \"Getting a reservation at Soothr feels nearly impossible, but lunch is definitely the way to go if you're trying to snag a spot. We managed to grab a table for three on a Saturday at 3 p.m., and even then, the place was packed. I can't imagine what the dinner rush looks like. The restaurant itself is tiny, so maneuvering around without bumping into someone is tricky. But despite the crowd, the service was great, and the food came out almost instantly, which was surprising given how busy it was.\\n\\nWe started with the Duck Rolls and Hai Yai Chicken as appetizers. The Duck Rolls were piping hot but honestly felt overpriced at $14. They were tasty, but they were basically fancy vegetable spring rolls with barely any duck. I'd skip them next time. The Hai Yai Chicken was just okay--nothing special.\\n\\nFor the mains, we tried the Seafood Tom Yum Noodles, Panang Duck Lychee Curry, and Koong Karee. The Seafood Tom Yum Noodles were definitely the highlight--the broth was incredibly flavorful and one of the best Tom Yum soups I've had. The Lychee Duck Curry was interesting, with a unique flavor profile, but the duck itself was a bit chewy, as the fat wasn't rendered properly. My favorite dish had to be the Koong Karee--the umami flavors were off the charts. I just wish it came with more rice to soak it all up.\\n\\nOverall, Soothr was a good experience, but maybe a bit overhyped. Still, it was enjoyable, especially for the Tom Yum and Koong Karee.\", 'Sis and I been craving Thai so we popped for some munchies near the end of lunch service around 3 for my birthday!  We were seated relatively quickly and ordered 2 apps, 2 mains, and a cocktail. \\n\\nApps:\\nHai Ye Fried Chicken. Crispy and Juicy though some parts are a little overdone so some bits of meat are dry. Overall good chicken though.\\n\\nDuck Rolls- spring rolls with duck and woodear mushroom. Crispy and fresh, but mainly woodear and not much duck flavor honestly. Still good though, really can\\'t mess up a good spring roll regardless.\\n\\nMains:\\nLychee Duck Curry: the curry itself is massaman curry with a hint of sweetness from the lychee. The duck breast is prepared similarly to the French style with a clear distinction between the meat n the fat and while it\\'s pretty like that, because the fat isn\\'t rendered down, it doesn\\'t taste as good and is a bit chewy. Curry is very nice though.\\n\\nKoong Karee- signature shrimp curry and had a very present fish paste flavor to it. The shrimps are super soft and done perfectly though idk why just leave the tails on lol.\\n\\nIf I had to choose, I would want the Massaman curry with the Shrimps because I prefer that curry but I prefer the shrimp over the duck overall.\\nBoth curries are very much \"rice thiefs\", a Korean term that refers to dishes that basically demand that you eat them with rice. I ordered another bowl of rice specifically because I ran out before I finished the curry. \\n\\nAs for the cocktail, I got a Rose Quartz one and it is simply beautiful, the way it\\'s served. I quite enjoyed it, not too bitter overall with a nice bit of fruity sweetness. We also got free birthday shots, and the shots themselves were very nice and refreshing as well. Besides that, I do wish the water in our glasses were colder though. There was no ice in the water jugs they had so the water itself was rather tepid.\\n\\nOverall, still quite the good experience though, and would definitely do a takeout of one of their curry dishes.', \"Came here with a reservation for dinner with my sister and it was busy! Have heard so much hype for this place so I was really excited. Even with a reservation you wait outside for them to call you in, and once you're inside you see why... it's so packed! Tables are literally back to back. The ambiance is super lively, definitely a happening place. \\n\\nWe ordered the Duck Noodles, Koong Karee, and Moo Dang Puff. I also got the Amethyst drink which was very aesthetic with the butterfly-pea gin. The Moo Dang Puff was full of flavor, and the perfect start to the meal. The Koong Karee is saucy and served with rice. There are not a ton of shrimp, but the curry sauce is delicious and flavorful! But the Duck Noodles was my favorite dish- the duck was so soft and tender! The noodles were perfectly chewy and had the tastiest gravy sauce. There was also a crunchy fried garlic topping that was delicious. \\n\\nService was fast and attentive, they get you in and out in 90 minutes. We also had a nut allergy which they were able to accommodate. Overall I can see why this place is so popular- truly delicious food! Just make sure you come with a reservation!\", 'I really enjoyed my meal at Soothr this evening! I understand why this restaurant was well regarded by Michelin. It\\'s a nice sized restaurant (there are several rooms) with a casual vibe. The service was very good, the menu had a nice variety of dishes and overall I was pleased with my meal! We arrived early and they let us know that they would try their best to seat us before our reservation time and they did, which I really appreciated. I told our server that I was looking to order a dish that was mild and she told me, \"it\\'s not too spicy, you can handle it\" which I think next time, I would not take this advice and I\\'d order something different, personally. More on that later. \\n\\nHere\\'s what I ordered: \\n\\nThai iced tea ($7)- definitely a little pricey in my opinion but it was very good and not too sweet. \\n\\nDuck rolls ($14)- the order came with four pieces and there was a sweet sauce. The rolls were filled with braised duck, leeks and wood ear mushrooms. They had a nice crunch! I\\'d order them again. \\n\\nRoasted vegetable trio Masamun curry ($20)- this dish was one of my favorites! The curry was tasty. I\\'d say a little better than other Masamun curries I\\'ve had. I didn\\'t find the portion size to be large enough though. I was yearning for more pumpkin, cauliflower and potatoes. \\n\\nChicken khao soi ($21)- I loved the chicken with super crispy skin and the contrast between crispy and soft egg noodles (crispy on top and tender underneath), however the sauce was too spicy for me. If you enjoy spice, I\\'d order this! The curry was too spicy for me. \\n\\nWe were celebrating and they gave us shots of their margarita with mezcal, tequila, tamarind and Thai chili- this was so so so good!! \\n\\nSoothr is really great! I\\'d enjoy visiting again to try different dishes.', 'Overall: what a spot! Plenty of Thai food to try in NYC and this is one well worth it. The price might run a bit scary but the flavors are well worth it. \\n\\nFood: started off with duck rolls that had the flakey crispy layered texture with the unique duck fatty flavor inside. The duck fat juice blends with the fried roll to make a mouthwatering bite. \\n\\nThe Lad Na crispy noodles brought out the strong mushroom flavor in the gravy-esque broth. The crispy noodles mixed in add a nice crunchy texture. \\n\\nThe braised beef with rice had that tender melt in your mouth feel. The spices and basil flavor popular in Thai cuisine really accentuated the beef flavor as you get a sweet spicy aromatic flavor bomb in your mouth. \\n\\nThe only subpar dish was the crab fried rice which felt like crab and fried rice cooked separately. Not much crab flavor in the rice but the hot sauces that came with it were exceptional. \\n\\nAmbience/service/decor: really lively place with varying groups of couples to friends to family. The vibrant food adds to the vibrant and creative decorations to make an exuberant ambience. The service was fairly quick with the dishes and taking our orders even though we sat in the back corner.', \"Soothr Thai in East Village is a must-visit for authentic flavors with a comforting twist. I tried the braised short rib, which was tender and flavorful, practically melting in my mouth with a rich, aromatic sauce that perfectly complemented the meat. The pad see ew was another highlight--perfectly chewy noodles with just the right amount of smoky flavor, and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. The cozy atmosphere and attentive service made the experience even better. If you're in NYC, Soothr is definitely worth a visit!\", \"Soothr lived up to the hype! From appetizers to entrees these dishes were unique and memorable, going above and beyond your most typical Thai dishes.\\n\\nWe got the duck rolls and shrimp/pork dumplings to start, which were both delicious and I could eat 10 of. We especially loved the duck rolls, so crispy and hot and fresh, but both were excellent.\\n\\nThe duck noodles were saucy and delightful, but our favorites were the beef pad see ew and and the beef pad ka prow. The beef was so tender and delicious.\\n\\nMy only small complaints are they were out of mango sticky rice, and the waiter spilled a little beer on my gf which I think warrants a drink or something getting comped; he was apologetic but didn't offer. Water is one thing, beer is pretty annoying. \\n\\nAnyway, great experience overall and highly recommend getting a Rez which can be hard!\", \"Soothr was so delicious! I was running late to our reservation beyond the 15 minutes window on a Friday night, but they were able to still accommodate us once we reached and I really appreciate all of their efforts.\\n\\nThe food was really delicious and portion sizes were generous! We had the Crab Fried Rice (I loved the chili sauce that came with it), Chicken Kao Soi, Duck Noodles, the Shrimp Pad Thai. The food was great and I was so surprised by how quickly they were able to prepare our dishes within minutes of us ordering it- but they were on top of it and I guess it may be because they want to try to accommodate as many people as possible to have a chance to try it which is great.  They do have a 90 minute seating limit, but they are so quick with serving the food so it's nothing to worry about. Would highly recommend and the Michelin star they received is very well deserved!\", \"Some folks have higher standards for this place because of all the hype - please believe me when I say the hype is well-deserved. I've been twice and have gotten the chance to try a variety of dishes - all of which have been tasty. \\n\\nSome of my favorite dishes:\\n- Roasted Eggplant Salad - must-get every time. such a flavor-forward, innovative starter\\n- Ba Mii Lobster Claw - I think this is a seasonal special. If you are so lucky to encounter it, please try it\\n- Xiao Xingxing - also seasonal. loved the filling, fish roe, and pairing with the sauce\\n- Tom Yum seafood hotpot - perfect for a cold day\\n- Panang Duck Lychee Curry - a fun mix of ingredients and an innovative take on a Thai curry dish\\n\\nShoutout to the servers here! I hosted a larger group (~12 people) and they were very responsive during the planning process and so accommodating of us during our meal. The servers were happy to make conversation with our group, take pictures, help us with our coats & umbrellas, adjust the temperature, and overall so friendly. Thanks Soothr!

Over, and over again. \\n\\nI ended up ordering some food to soak up all the extra liquor I hadn\\'t planned on imbibing, and I was pleasantly surprised by the wings, the fried rice, and the scallion pancakes. All excellent, and the latter two are not things I normally expect to eat at dive bars.\\n\\nAs we stumbled out, the bartender shook his head disapprovingly at our inability to handle 4-5 shots of whiskey in rapid succession (after a long evening of drinking just before), \"You\\'re not in Fishmarket shape.\"\\n\\nWell, I guess I\\'ll have to get in Fishmarket shape, and I\\'ll be back.', \"Hands down one of the best home style Thai restaurants disguised as a dive bar.

Their seafood selection is consistently fresh and diverse, offering something for every taste. I always find myself returning for the fried rice, which perfectly complements any dish I choose. The casual atmosphere makes it a great spot to unwind with friends or family, and it's always a reliable choice when I'm craving a hearty, satisfying meal without any fuss.\", \"Food (5/5): Wow the food is absolutely amazing and delicious. Truly a hole in the wall type of place with really great dishes and food. I ordered the beef rendang, dumplings, and Mama's curried chicken while some friends ordered other dishes. The rendang was absolutely delicious with amazing sauce and super tender meat. Some of the best I've had.\\n\\nService (3/5): While some of the staff had great energy, don't expect upscale type service here. They served food in to go containers, paper plates, and disposable plastic cutlery. Additionally, some of the food came fast but some of my friends had to wait a while for their fried chicken. Also, be aware there is a 3% surcharge for credit card. We accidentally paid with card and when asked if we can change to cash after finding out about the charge, they seemed to not want to try to figure it out so we left if as-is. One thing I appreciated was they worked to fit our group of 8 and moved us to a more spacious table when it was available. Overall, not the best service but there is some charming aspects.\\n\\nAmbiance (4/5): We came as a large group of 8 after an event at Tin Building and I picked this spot because it was close and had great Yelp ratings. I was really confused at first looking at the restaurant from the outside because it seemed shady and not the usual Asian restaurant look. The door also had a broken door handle so it was hard to open.  When we finally figured out how to open the door, it seemed like an American dive bar rather than a Malaysian restaurant. So we ended up walking out, double checking if it's the right place and thinking if we should go elsewhere. But one of the staff who was working opened the door again and someone from the staff said don't be scared, just come in. So we decided to go for it since there was available seating. The whole place seemed to be doing lively karaoke and drinking and we were the ones there mostly for the food. It was a super interesting and unique vibe that I hadn't seen before. Feels like if we were in Malaysia and the Malaysians were trying to make an American Dive / Sports bar restaurant. Tons of flags everywhere and sports playing on many TV's.\", 'Yum and fun! This is always a great spot for great vibes, drinks; and food. The owners here are the best and very personable. The crispy fried rice is actually amazing!!! It is so tasty and flavorful. I really enjoyed that the most.', \"This is the epitome of a local dive bar. \\nHard to find, if you can open the door you're lucky. \\n\\nStrong drinks.

If you don\\'t, this is a bit of an off the radar spot to add to your rotation to impress out-of-towners with your underground knowledge of the city.', \"This place is packed   How do they still get drinks on time, food hot, and a free shot???\\nListen, I have lived in the shadows of Manhattan my whole life.  I have eaten at the best and worst places  \\nThis is hands down the best fried rice ever!!!! \\nWings were great  \\nEveryone is friendly Including the customers   \\n\\nI'm coming back\", 'We enjoyed our evening at Fish Market! An unpretentious small bar with good meals and excellent service! Our server was really nice and cheerful!

But the food was wonderful, and the staff was friendly!', 'No frills or pretentiousness dive bar with stellar fish and chips. Fish is flakey, lightly battered and perfectly crisp. French fries are slightly burnt but I like them overdone. They were fast and polite ordering from the bar. Highly recommend this hole in the wall', \"I've had Fishmarket Restaurant bookmarked for ages and decided to stop in yesterday afternoon. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, we spent about 10 mins trying to get inside. I was grabbing and pulling for dear life on the only door with a doorknob outside the bar with no success. Turns out the second door WITHOUT any doorknob or place to pull the door is how you get in. You have to grab the top of the door and pull. I had no idea, but finally someone saw me struggling and kicked the door open to let us in. \\n\\nThey have an American menu and a Mama's Malaysian menu. I came all the way out here to try Mama's legendary food, so we ordered the shrimp puffs, curried chicken, and crispy shrimp fried rice. All the food comes out in to-go containers with paper plates. I thought the food was delicious and flavorful. The curry chicken is on the spicy side but comes with white rice to balance it out. The crispy rice was amazing too, and the shrimp puffs were tasty. \\n\\nWe got a free round of Jameson shots after we finished our food which was super nice of them. After we finished our shots, the true VIP arrived: Mama. I was kind of bummed that she arrived after I ordered my food as I thought she was in the back the whole time. Everyone immediately stopped what they were doing to give her a warm welcome. \\n\\nTLDR: the food was great, the atmosphere was rowdy (the Giants game was on and full of fans), and you have to literally earn your way in here.\", \"A hole in the wall. This bar is near my best friend's apartment in the city and we come here every time I visit her. Nothing special about the drinks, but the owners are extremely friendly and cool. Every hour or so, one of them will go around with a bottle of Jameson and shot glasses. We would do free shots all together! Pretty cool, right! They do this throughout the night.\\n\\nThe highlight of this place is the food. I heard it's one of the owners mom that does the cooking. The crispy fried rice here is the best! We have also tried the chicken wings and fried shrimp. Both are good, but we never leave until we have the fried rice. \\n\\nThe bathroom is kind of gross, especially towards the end of the night. I try to avoid it at all cost. The place can use some remodeling or at least get the door fix, but I guess that's charm of this place.\", \"The best chicken wings I've ever had, anywhere, hands down. The crispy fried rice is also phenomenal. This is absolutely a dive bar, but the food is incredible. The staff is great, and if you're lucky, you might get a complimentary shot or two of Jameson.\", \"The food is great, the drinks are free flowing, and the space is a ton of fun. I had previously really enjoyed the bar until a rough encounter with the bar owner. He yelled at our friend for helping the server bus a table and cursed at her. Absolutely inexcusable to curse at a customer who was just trying to help out. He only apologized after a long discussion, and it wasn't very sincere. It was incredibly disappointing and I've never encountered anything like this at a bar. The rest of the employees have all been great, but the owner was a real jerk to us and I can't recommend supporting his business.\", \"This place is the ultimate dive.  No handle on the door and looks potentially closed... getting in makes you feel like an insider.  Once inside it feels like a typical college dive bar...except this one serves some top notch Asian bar food.  Some dishes are quite spicy, so be careful when ordering...lively place, awesome people, cold beer And great food. Plus free shots if you're there for a while.\", \"If you can find your way into this spot, it's so warm and welcoming.  Everyone seems to know everyone and the hospitality couldn't have been better.  It's a no frills spot where the drinks are strong the music is at a volume where you can still talk to your friends without having to yell and there's TVs if you want to watch a game.  Will definitely be back to try the food next time.\", \"friendliest dive bar with great food! was a bit confused because the interior looks like a typical sports bar, tons of jerseys and football playing everywhere. but the food was mostly asian and tasted amazing. the sausage fried rice was one of the best fried rices i've had at a restaurant. the bartender also came around with shots to do together. it's definitely really loud and crowded but very lively. also hard to find, there's no door handle so you need to pry the door open from the top haha\", 'This is a dive bar with style. The bathroom, graffitied floor to ceiling with a mop, bucket and other cleaning supplies (presumably used periodically) tucked next to the toilet is quintessential dive bar. There is a hole, but not a glorious one (at least on the day I was there). This hole was perhaps related to frustrations by who ever wrote \"go bills\" in block letters on the door.\\n\\nThe menu is very diverse and everything is good. Fish n chips, wings, curry chicken, fried rice... all amazing. \\n\\nThe service is great, the bartenders come around every hour or so and offer everyone free shots. There are TVs all over the place with college football, baseball, basketball or whatever sport is in season.', \"This is my favorite surprise restaurant in NYC. Order off the Malaysian menu. My family is from Malaysia and Singapore so I know the food is good and authentic. Don't be thrown off by the lack of signage or door without a handle.

This is easily the best Malaysian food in the city--and it's served in a no frills dive bar at no frills prices, the way Malaysian Mama intended.\\n\\nI came with a native Malaysian/food influencer who, let's just say, knows his sh*t. Everything was perfectly cooked, authentic and bursting with spices. \\n\\nWe got the Stuffed Eggplant, Mama's Curried Chicken and Spicy Shrimp Noodle Soup. The eggplant stuffing was rich and complex. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and its curry was thick, grainy and perfectly representative of Ipoh style (something you just can't find in NYC). But the soup was what stole the show. I can't begin to describe how richly infused with shrimp this broth was. If actual shrimp had been liquefied into the stock, it couldn't have been more flavorful. It was shrimpy, it was spicy, it was piping hot deliciousness that made me want to cry crustacean tears of joy. \\n\\nEverything was served in plastic and paper, which just added to the hole-in-the-wall charm. Our bartender/server was awesome, and we got to chat with the owner's mom in Malay (as well as the owner himself)--so really, this is like taking the 2 train to Malaysia at 1/100th the cost.\", \"Service was a full 5 stars...loved the Jameson shots, the attentiveness and friendliness. The vibe in here is just awesome. \\n\\nChicken curry was our favorite...the best flavor, perfect amount of spice. Ginger chicken wings were also great...piping hot and crispy. I would've liked some kind of sweet/spicy sauce for dipping...idk they needed something. We ended up dipping them in the leftover curry sauce. Crispy shrimp fried rice was also good. Scallion pancakes were ok. \\n\\nAnyway, just the vibe alone here is worth coming for. Pull the door from the top left corner. Walk in like and feel like they've been waiting for you all night!\", \"Quick tip: pull on the upper left side of the door to enter. You won't find a door handle or door knobs.\\nWe spent a good 30 seconds searching for a hidden door knocker and ended up pulling on the bottom left part of the door. After reading reviews it would have been nice to know that it's the *top left* part of the door.\\n\\nAnyways, on to the good stuff. Walking into this spot the first thing I noticed was some Finance bros talking about acquisitions, million dollar contracts, etc. Later in the evening a few healthcare workers stopped by. There were some locals at the bar watching the Knicks game. All in all, this place just felt homey and was filled with caring people.\\n\\nWe were greeted by Jeff and John. I think we stepped on their toes because there was 1 minute left in the basketball game and they rushed us for the order. Whoops. \\n\\nYou have the choice of the American menu or the Asian menu and we went for the Malaysian foods. We ordered the scallion pancake, the shrimp dumplings, the curry chicken, and the sausage crispy fried rice.\\nNever have I seen buffalo sauce served with fried rice, but it was amazing. I'm still thinking about that dish 24 hours later. \\n\\nThis place is absolutely the best of dive bars with unbelievable food, and very welcoming staff (just be sure not to interrupt during an important ball game). \\n\\nThe only shame is that I can't visit this place more often. If I lived/worked in this area I'd absolutely become a regular. It's quirky, it's fun, you'll get some Jameson shots from the friendly bartender, and you'll never, ever forget how good the food is.\\n\\nThis place belongs in a bar/restaurant Hall of Fame.\", 'Walked in and out within a minute. Horrible attitude and service. Rudest people alive. Do not recommend!', \"Wow. The Indonesian food here is amazing. The menu includes american standard things too(I did not try), but omg the spicy prawn noodle soup (bartender's recommendation), spicy green bean chicken and the calamari were just excellent. Yes, the food is served in take-out bowls and paper plates, the bar is a dive bar, just with more tables than normal, but that is  the charm. They are serving real deal Indonesian food in solid portions with an excellent staff who does care what you think and a hopin' crowd having fun. \\n\\nPro tip: Reach up high at the front door (no doorknob), grab the top of the door and pull to get in.\", \"Lobster roll $20 bucks and tiny tiny tiny. The smallest amount of fries too. If you can't make a lobster roll at a decent price and a decent size, don't have it on the menu at all. I mean, that's what a restaurant that takes pride in its food would do.\\n\\nTaking down a star because waiter argues that Luke's lobster roll was just as a small. Great argument. Let's lower the bar, shall we? Also it made me think about going to Luke's lobster to check it out.\\n\\nI had a spicy shrimp noodles on a previous visit and they weren't anything to write home about either. However they do give you free shots of Jamison's occasionally...so woo hoo.\", \"Came here bc we saw reviews raving about the Malaysian menu. We ordered mama's curried chicken, spicy prawn soup, and stuffed eggplants. We thought they tasted decent but their portions were pretty small. The restaurant/bar itself had fun vibes tho and the employees/owners(?) were super attentive and friendly. They checked in with us many times about how the food was. Not sure if I'd come back bc the food wasn't memorable to us but maybe to check out the bar.\", \"Came here for some late night drinks. What they say is true, the owners do come around and give out shots of Jameson and we had to see it for ourselves. It is intense... but awesome. \\n\\nThe food here was awesome, although a little expensive. I guess they gotta pay for that Jameson somehow! \\n\\nThe place itself is pretty small. It is pretty cramped and has a lot of stylistic choices going on. I would say it is a dive bar that took a bunch of free decorations and hung them up. Some things were definitely of questionable choice, but it is what it is. \\n\\nWould come back here for drinks, but probably wouldn't eat here!\", \"RUDEST, WORST SERVICE EVER. The people who work here are SO aggressive and miserable for no reason. Honestly put me off for life. Don't come here if you wanna deal with that as soon as you walk in.\", 'Food was so so flavorful (get the fried rice!!!) and atmosphere was unbeatable. Great vibes, fun staff and overall company.', \"Honestly feel like this place hasn't gotten enough reviews! A very nice dive bar serving just the best Malaysian food. The mama's chicken curry blew our minds. We loved it so much we had to get some to go. We also got the drunken fish soup and the scallion pancakes which were really good. \\nWe were here on a Sunday afternoon during the NFL games and the Jameson shots kept flowing. A truly hidden gem, a must visit if you're in the area!\", \"Service was rude and unprofessional. Wanted to grab a drink with friends but the bartender would not accept our IDs even though we are all well over the legal age. Even when multiple forms of ID we're shown, bartender wanted to protect his ego not admitting he was wrong, still refused to serve.\", 'Perfect\\nThe best place in the world, i wanna spend everyday there, dont expect a red carpet expect a good time every-time you go there', 'A truly \"hole in the wall\" dive under the FDR that does not even have a door knob. Orders taken by one son, cocktails mixed by another (?), dishes cooked by the MAMA, and brought out by two colored youth. The sausage fried rice was the crispest that I ever had. Scallion pancake was also authentic. The spicy shrimp noodle soup has generous portions of shrimp but it was too spicy for our palate. Yes, they also offered free Jameson shots.', \"My face was on fire. Am i just super weak sauce at this fine age? \\n\\nIt's been a long time since I've been here, but someone described it as the best Malaysian in NY. I don't know about that, but i was pretty satisfied with our order. Don't let the take out containers fool you, you are allowed to stay. ;-)\\n\\nCrispy fried rice was flavorful and textured (actually crispy), Spicy Shrimp Noodle Soup lured me in then hit me hard. I managed to finish it, but i hadn't challenged myself like that for a while, and the chicken curry was also very good (especially on the rice). \\n\\nFriendly service, good food - I'll see you again.\", \"The best crispy shrimp fried rice you will ever have. A true local joint don't come with any attitude or you will be dissed.\", \"Order from Mama's menu!  Incidental finding while in the area and so glad we did!  Been back during every visit to NYC!\", \"Best bar in NYC - great service and surprisingly good food. Most fun I've ever had in my life\", \"Came here on a Wednesday with my friend and NOW I WANT TO COME BACK ON A WEEKEND. \\n\\nThe food is great, the atmosphere is fun (dive bar vibes FOR SURE) - Fishmarket is such a gem in fidi!!! The bartender somehow knew my SOUL and not only made my drink strong, but gave me some whisky shots as well. He said the place was vvvv fun on the weekends, so definitely make the visit if you're in the area! \\n\\nThey have an American menu and an Asian menu from MAMAs. Not sure who mama is, but her food is PHENOMENAL. We ordered the pork belly bowl and the crispy rice with shrimp. Both were DELICIOUS. I'm sad we didn't order the curry but I will definitely be back to try it again - it was highly recommended.\\n\\nThe crispy rice was ADDICTING. SO CRISPY, SO FLAVORFUL. I think I ate 90% of this dish and I feel bad that I may have been hogging this plate. The pork belly was SOOOO SOFT and melts in your mouth. How they cooked this so well, I have no idea - but it tasted so authentic! I was honestly surprised that this food exists in FIDI. \\n\\nI also appreciated that the vaccine cards were checked (and thoroughly). All food came in disposable containers so they felt cleaner during COVID times, and if you don't finish - you can just take it to go right away! \\n\\nHIGHLYYYYY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR A FUN TIME AND DELICIOUS FOOD!!!!\", 'Geez talk about off the beaten path. Took my family here to celebrate the Lunar New Year cause everything was booked in Chinatown. I walked in a week before to check it out and was worried. It is a hole in the wall bar. The type I LOVE when I was in my 20\\'s but not so sure about a family dinner with three toddlers. \\n\\nThe food is FIRE!!!!!  We ordered almost everything off Mama\\'s menu and EVERYTHING was so flavorful and good. Pork belly, yummy noodles, beef rendang, stuffed eggplants were out of this world. But their \"simple\" dishes that I normally write off were excellent. The flavors was complex and delicate. It didn\\'t over power you with garlic or coconut or spice. Even their chicken and string beans were so subtlety delicious. \\n\\nYes we ate off of paper plates, take out containers and drank from solo cups but gone was the pretentiousness of fine dining replaced with really good comfort food. \\n\\nA true diamond in the rough. Service was great. Alex was fantastic and while the Bills lost (it was on all the TV\\'s) and the bar was raging, our family dinner was fun and everybody including all the foodie aunties were happy. Couldn\\'t ask for more.', \"I've been coming here every time I'm in the area for about 4 years now. You know what to expect when you come here, terrific food cooked by Mom and her boys running the show at the bar. I had my birthday party here recently and Jeff made sure all the details were taken care of. We brought our own cake, but to my surprise Jeff had another cake lined up for me. Don't even hesitate coming here, just gooooooooooo! \\nThanks Jeff for making my bday a great time !!!\", \"It's the dive bar you never knew you needed. It's loud. It's crowded. But everyone that's here comes back here over and over again. It's not a huge spot but has a full bar with seating including tables and chairs. The owner is fun and friendly and has a habit of sharing his love for Jameson with his patrons. I've partaking in a complimentary shot or two. And though he may not know my name he acknowledges me and the fact that I am a recurring customer whenever I stop in.\\n\\nI've had their lobster special. It's good! I also had the sauteed bok choy. Delish. This place doesn't look like much but the good is great. The drinks are strong. The company is lively. The bartenders are attentive.\\n\\nIt might take a bit of finesse to get into the door, seeing as there's no door knob. Ha! But I'm sure you'll figure it out!\", \"Wasn't expecting that. But that was good. Visiting from San Francisco and looking for some legit Malaysian food in NYC. A passerby had to instruct us to grab the top of the door to open ( no handle) into to a low key country dive bar. I liked the music but am I in the right place?  \\n\\nWell take a few steps towards the back and there a some casual tables. Got served the savory Ginger Chicken Wings on paper plates and the out of this world Drunken Fish Soup in foam cups. Crispy Fried Rice and Curry Chicken rounded out the dinner. This was legit Malaysian food. \\n\\nThen the fun starts. The waiter and owner giving out Jameson shots from mini salsa to-go cups. We had to politely decline the third round of shot as we still had to find our way to the subway. Definitely will be back when we visit NYC next year.\", \"The music is blasting.  The crowd is all positive vibes. The food is delicious. Steve is amazing.\\nThe bok choy was my favorite. It was seasoned and crunchy. The shrimp were fresh and clean and a nice size. The chicken wings were my other favorite. They were fried hard and flavorful to the bone. The stuffed flounder was made with love. I can't wait to return.\", 'Delicious food and great bartenders.\\nWe had the yummy noodles (spicy warning), ginger wings and clams. Everything was great! So full but had to finish everything.\\nFriendly bartenders/owners that made us feel very welcome plus free Jameson shots! Lol\\nOverall 5 stars', \"I honestly never been here before and wish I'd known about it whenever I came to the area way back. \\n\\nI didn't want to use my hands at the moment so I got the crispy fried rice with chinese sausage ($15). It was super crispy, felt super light, and was so yummy! I honestly want to go back to try mama's curry chicken! \\n\\nI also got the pineapple vodka ($12) since they didn't have any cranberry juice, and that was superb as well! \\n\\nThe atmosphere is super loud, but chill and friendly. The waiters are super nice that they even walked around offering a shot to everyone. I had no idea until I saw what was happening and wish I would've joined in haha.  And mama who cooks everything had also come out, she is such a sweet lady. \\n\\nIf you're in the area and want a good bite somewhere, definitely go to fishmarket restaurant!\", \"Is it time to go back yet? \\n\\nIt's rare to find a place so inviting that you feel sad to leave and plan your next trip while the chicken wings are still hot. But that's the draw of Fish Market. The food was amazing and the vibe matched. Everyone who worked there was friendly, engaging, and energetic. \\n\\nOrder the fish soup, please order the fish soup. \\n\\nAside from that, order everything from Mama's menu. Just do it.

The oysters were super fresh.\\n\\nI got the gnocchi as an entree. They were the perfect texture--not too chewy. I would have liked a thicker sauce on them but they were still yummy.

I hate Mezcal but the drink my friend ordered was perfectly mixed and made the smoky flavor of the Mezcal actually tolerable. \\n\\nNow on to the negatives: my friend tried to order food from a gentleman at the bar but was told she had to order from an actual bartender. There was a lot of hustle and bustle at the bar where we couldn't tell who was a bartender or bar back. I talked to this petite female (possibly Latina) with a pony tail and asked if I could order from her since we were told earlier not everyone can take food orders. Well she gave me a disgusted look and snapped at me,  asking me what I needed to order. I was a bit taken aback by her nasty attitude, but gave her my order. Even my friends overheard and asked me why she was being so mean.

The portions were very generous, and the desserts were the highlight of our meal.', \"The restaurant was so pretty with all the Christmas decorations and the seats were so comfy. \\n\\nHowever the first server we had during the happy hour was not very helpful and gave us an attitude. Glad that another server was serving us at dinner time. \\n\\nThe food was okay. The portion was okay. But the drinks were better.

The plush seating and dimly lit, moody lighting create an atmosphere of pure romance and relaxation.\\n\\nAnd the drinks! The cocktail menu is a true work of art, with unique and innovative creations that will tantalize your tastebuds.

Ceasar with real anchovy but subtly played was standout.  Pork chop and filet mignon both excellently prepared.  The braised cabbage was otherwordly and baked potato side with creme fraiche and chives was wonderful.  Both were big enough to share.  A flight of bourbon (American bold) was fun and they helped inform on a great way to make each to your perfect slight dilution.  \\n\\nThe room is spectacular with great music, great cocktail vibe for date nights.\\n\\nService was a 4.5 - attentive and solid.', \"I visited this establishment last week not knowing of its existence until then. My only regret is that I did not learn of The Parlour Room sooner. This place has it all - ambience, fantastic food/drinks, stellar service, need I go on? \\n\\nWe had an array of appetizers to start - oysters, tuna tartar, and meatballs. Everything tasted great. We washed down everything with some excellently prepared cocktails. Next, our server explained the menu items she'd recommend for the group and drinks to accompany them. We settled on caesar salads, a tomahawk steak, fries, and spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and paired well with the salads. \\n\\nWhether you are coming here for a nice cocktail at the bar or a full service dinner, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant and am looking forward to coming back very soon.\", \"Was easy to make a reservation, and so glad we did. This place was packed, even for a 6pm reservation on a Wednesday.\\n\\nThe ambiance is amazing. Exactly how you'd expect a whiskey Parlour room to be like. Wall full of whiskeys, and cute tables and couches. Not great for large groups, but definitely good for a date or few friends.\\n\\nService was great. Very friendly and attentive.

Meal was paced properly, and didn't feel rushed.\\n\\nWe got the meatballs to start off, and they were some of the best I've ever had! They were generous to give us around 4-5 of them to share. \\n\\nAfter the meatballs, we ordered the Steak Frittes and Short Rib. The Short Rib was slightly underwhelming for NYC quality food, but it was fork tender like it should be. I expected a little more flavor and it would've done well with a red wine demiglaze or something to spruce it up. The polenta that it came with was very nice. I wish it came with a veggie too for a fully well-rounded meal. \\n\\nOverall, good find!\", \"The food was great and we loved the atmosphere, but the service was horrible. We had an okay start, our server wasn't the most friendly/personable - but that wasn't the issue. Halfway through our meal, she disappeared without a word and no one else checked in - someone came and cleared the table, but we finished our drinks and weren't able to order anything else. Our plates were cleared and drinks were empty for 30 minutes before I had to pull a random server aside to pay the bill. \\n\\nThis was probably the reservation that we were the most excited for, so we were extremely disappointed.\", 'Has a wonderful expertise here!\\nStopped in before a Broadway show - made reservations ahead of time. \\n\\nPlace is absolutely beautiful and the food and drinks were amazing. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken, vinaigrette dressing and cranberries. My mom has the short ribs, which were extremely soft. They practically melted in your mouth.

Drinks were amazing. Highly recommend for a specialty cocktail. The place is beautiful and really upscale for a grown and sexy vibe. The waiters and reception weren't the warmest but it's fine.\", \"This place was just ok. My friends and I went here for brunch. Overpriced Manhattan prices. There are better brunch spots other places. They ran out of biscuits which is apart of their southern breakfast (which I wanted). So I pivoted and ordered the steak & eggs. They had mixed up my over easy eggs with my friend's scrambled eggs. 2 of my other friends got the frittata; they needed hot sauce; kinda bland.\\nIt was a fine meal. Nothing to rave about. Some of my friends were still hungry afterwards. \\nThe grapefruit pitcher for $55 was weak and not mixed very well. The server could care less. Service is very subpar. They act like they are doing us a favor. Very mediocre. The bathrooms are downstairs. The place has a nice layout. The whiskey tasting could be cool, but I did not try that. Their sister restaurant, which was next door was booming way more than them. I would not return or recommend this place.\", \"Outstanding selection of whiskey here. I focused on the Bourbon offerings, but saw great bottles from an offering of Scotch, Irish, Japanese, and American distillers.\\n\\nAt this spot - I tried Weller 107 and Russell's 13. Not the cheapest place (both of my choices were under $25 for a 1oz pour), but I figured I could try something I hadn't had anyplace else for a palatable cost. Both of my choices failed to disappoint and my colleagues, who took my recommendations, agreed that both drams were tasty.\\n\\nI did not eat here, but the food that was whisked by to other tables looked tasty.\\n\\nPlenty of seating, a romantic/dark vibe, and somewhat of a business casual crowd.\\n\\nI tried this spot around 6ish on a Monday, so couldn't say how crowded it might get - but my party of 4 was seated for drinks only at a nice table with comfortable chairs near the bar as we walked in.\\n\\nIf whiskey is your thing, this is a definite stop if you are in midtown and craving the tasty brown juice!\", 'Great drinks.

Food was average but yummy.', \"Good setting, great cocktails & impactful staff!\\n\\nStopped in for a pick-me-up cocktail after getting off the train from DC, ended up staying for three and you should too.\\n\\nThe good: solid cocktails that are well made without excessive nonsense. I had a spin on a whiskey highball and my wife mixed it up with a tequila and then rum based cocktail both of which delighted her.\\nThe space. The bar opens up in a large but inviting room while this space can probably feel a bit busy there are also a good number of secluded tables for a more intimate couple or small group seating.\\nThe staff. Lots of bars in the city have skilled bartenders who quickly crank out excellent drink. The only exception to the bartenders here was their excellent hospitality, providing recommendations and showing a couple how the antique mechanical shaker behind the bar worked when they asked about it. \\n\\n10/10 see you next time I'm in town.\", 'Fun little whiskey bar. They had a really good server- he was selling the whiskey hard. But he picked some good ones, the Manhattan was strong and tasty.\\n\\nThe fries were ok.

We didn't get food, but drinks only and they're well crafted. Service was excellent and the interior design and ambiance is classy and vibrant. Dim lit and a bit noise.

Had a cider and a Bloody Mary, both of which quite tasty - and the Parlor Room Breakfast (sausages, bacon, eggs and potatoes with peppers) as my meal, and really enjoyed it - portions weren\\'t massive but at least not small either.\\n\\nService was good, the staff are pretty attentive and accommodating; and the prices are reasonable by NYC standards.  We paid extra for access to this Jazz Music accompaniment (sort of like a live show), but it came with a \"free drink\" as part of the ticket at least.  \\n\\nThe music was lovely - the only issue there was that the band were on break for a fair bit; they were only performing for about half the time we were there.  \\n\\nThe manager and wait staff brought out a surprise birthday dessert for my friend, which I hugely appreciated - as did she!\\n\\nI\\'d be happy to come back for another one of their great cocktails, for sure.', 'We were looking for a place to grab some drinks on a Saturday evening, and luckily stumbled upon the spot. We had seen it from afar, but it looked really empty inside, but decided to give it a shot anyways, and when we walked in it stunned us.

Once we sat down, I knew we were in for a treat a pricey treat, but a treat. \\nOnly two of us from our party were drinking and enjoyed our cocktails tremendously , the presentation, the care in making the cocktail- everything about this place is elegance. \\nComing from the SF Bay aAea I did expect the drinks to be a little pricier, but was a little shocked at how pricey they were.

Me and my friends had a very good time.', 'Went to the Parlour Room for dinner on a Thursday evening! We started off with drinks - I got the Tropics in NYC and it was great! We ordered the deviled eggs and they were absolutely incredible. For our mains, we did the short rib and the steak frites. The food was so good and the portions were perfect - we even had leftovers. We skipped dessert because we had no room. Our server was so nice and helpful! The decor and ambiance were lovely - we liked the music and the unique decoration/furniture. The place was very spacious. Definitely would recommend and visit in the future.', 'The ambiance of The Parlour Room is exquisite. It is charming, elegant, and feels very appropriate for New York City. All of their cocktails are named after books, which is super fun. Although they are known for their whisky, I went for The Gatsby (a vodka) drink. It was delicious! The appetizer we ordered, the french onion dip, was also incredibly yummy. My entree, however, was not quite as good as the other two menu items already discussed. I ordered the mushroom risotto (one of their very few vegetarian options), and it was somehow both bland and too flavorful. It tasted like mushrooms and absolutely nothing else, which was off-putting and not appealing. I would definitely go back to try something else, if they added more vegetarian options to their menu!', 'Great place for drinks, food ambience and atmosphere.

It literally gives off 80s great gatsby vibes  perfect for date night! \\n\\nThey specialize in various whiskey cocktails! I really liked their most popular cocktail (into the raven? It's their smoked bourbon drink where it comes smoked )- strong but well balanced! \\n\\nTheir food is pretty solid as well, and I was not expecting that! We got the short rib and crab and cheese wantons( this came highly recommended, and I have to say it was indeed very good). Would recommend trying this! \\n\\nService: great! Waitress was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu.\", \"My friends and I had reservations to the Parlour Room in a Saturday night at 7 pm. Upon entering we were greeted  by the hosts and then immediately escorted to our table. This is a great place for a date, girls night, or birthday celebration I'd say.\\n\\nThe first thing you will notice when you enter this place is the decor. The entire vibe is so Victorian and absolutely stunning. All the artwork and books give it such a charm. They have a great collection of cocktails and food as well. Unfortunately we couldn't try too many good items as we weren't super hungry but, what we tried what delicious. The crab Rangoon and meatballs were both delicious and a decent portion size. Their beef Wellington and other items also sounded really tempting so, I'd definitely come back with an appetite to try them. Also loved the plush couches that were super comfortable to sit in. \\n\\nThe cocktails we ordered were also really delicious. Really smooth and well mixed. Also really liked our waitress. She was very friendly and attentive. Overall, had a great girls night and, would definitely come back here!\", 'This place has such a fantastic atmosphere! Good for a romantic date but also good for a night with friends ! The drinks are top notch h and the food was delish .... Although I think I had more of the amazing drinks than food ... but if you are anything like me and love a great atmosphere and a great cocktail and really good food this is your spot !', \"Very cool place. Our bartender was very nice (female). We had a tuna appetizer which was good. And my husband's bourbon drink was very good. I drink Grey, goose and cranberry my drink not so good. The cranberry they use on tap taste like cherry juice which is way too sweet for a vodka drinker. They should go back to ocean spray cranberry It is preferred by those who drink cranberry. Nice place, give it a try if you have not been here I think you'll like it.\", \"We had tickets to see Nas at MSG and wanted dinner prior to the concert but definitely didn't want fast food so we decided to make reservations here after reading the great reviews .\\n\\nOk so here we go...walking inside felt like prohibition mixed with a little speak easy and a dash of sexiness! The ambiance is GORGEOUS! After settling in on the velvet seating it was time to look over the menu. I wanted everything! We decided on the crab wontons as starters however I didn't get a picture because they were devoured immediately! Yes they were that good....lots of crab meat inside and not the fake stuff with a crispy flaky finish. For entrees we ordered the following:\\n\\nThe Parlour Wagyu beef burger with side of fries\\nCrispy skin Salmon with Risotto \\nLobster Mac & Cheese\\nSkirt Steak with duck fat potatoes \\n\\nAll were very tasty!!!! The duck fat potatoes are a huge portion to accompany a steak so I felt like it was overkill. The service was a little slow but very friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. \\n\\nWill go back!\", \"Decided to give The Parlour a try after a B Way show.  Had a reservation for 10:15, but they accommodated our early arrival.  The vibe is like a library or sitting in your study at home.  The drinks were good, but my pour was short.  The food was good, but slightly over priced.  My only complaint was after dinner was over and plates were gone we sat for a long time waiting to get our check.  Normally this would be ok, but when it's midnight I prefer to get my head on my pillow sooner than later...\", 'Nice place for a chat with a date or a friend over cocktails for grown ups. The decor has a sophisticated 1920\\'s step into the past feel. Terrific selection of whiskies but bring your fat wallet. \\n\\nNot really impressed by the menu. My friend ordered the braised beef over mashed potatoes & was asked \"what temperature would you like the meat?\"  Huh? What? It\\'s braised Bruh. Anyway, it was tender but appeared a bit dry. I had the mushroom toast. The toast element was nice. Thick slice of good bread. The mushroom selection was good (Pickled Beech Mushroom, Roasted Maitake, Oyster Mushroom) atop a piquillo ricotta spread & cashew pieces. I was deeply disappointed the toppings were ice cold though. The mushroom toast would be more impressive if the mushrooms were sautéed & placed atop the spread. \\n\\nIt is a beautiful space though & worthy of a visit from time to time. The sister space, the Ragtrader (next door) is a nice spot too.', \"If you want to have an awful experience come to this bar I'll guarantee that you'll be yelled by the staff and no understanding from the management team!\", 'Stopped in here with a business colleague on a week night without a reservation. Place was packed but they found us a table. Decor feels like a living room in a nice house. Very pleasant. Service was prompt and professional.  Drinks were perfect.

We sat on the patio, which was lovely. Our server was good and attentive.\\n\\nWe tried a few drinks--I got Dorian's temptation and my husband got one from the whiskey collection. We also tried the lamb samosas, which were delicious.\\xa0I would\\xa0definitely recommend this place for a relaxed night out.\", \"Great happy hour specials for food and drinks. Came here after work to catch-up with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the quiet and intimate upscale chic decor. They allow advance reservations with fireside seating areas and comfy sofas. The happy hour lasts tills 6pm and includes a solid maple whiskey and plentiful chips and tasty dip. The main bar fills up quickly but there's plenty of unique seating areas for different size groups.\", \"My friend and I saw a write-up on the new chef and wanted to give it a shot for after-work drinks/dinner.\\n\\nCocktails were delicious. We started with delicious Manhattans -- we could definitely tell that the bartenders know what they are doing.\\n\\nFor food, we had the meatballs, which were absolutely divine. The sauce was hearty and a little bit... smoky? It had body to it that absolutely charmed us. Also had the aranchini -- amazing --  and the oysters, which were beautifully dressed in a well-balanced and bright mignonette. \\n\\nI had the burger and my friend had the stuffed papardelle. Both were very good!\\n\\nFor dessert we had creme brulee and chocolate mousse with a clafoutis. I couldn't believe how good the creme brulee was.\\n\\n10/10, will definitely be back!\", 'We walked in shortly after they had opened and were not greeted. A lady came up to us and said they were not open until 3:30 even though it said 3:00 online. We left and came back after 3:30 and still no one greeted us. We walked in and saw all the workers just sitting and standing there and continued their conversation while we stood there. One of the workers looked at us with attitude and looked away while continuing to talk to her coworker. At this point we felt very unwelcome so we left. Felt so uncomfortable, never again.', \"What a beautiful bar with unsurpassed whisky selection.  They had many great whiskies that you can't find elsewhere.  The interior is incredibly beautiful especially decorated for the holidays.   The service was impeccable.\\n\\nDefinitely a great place for after work drinks or nightcap.  Highly recommended.\", \"Second visit from last year. \\nJust as great from start to finish. Great atmosphere, decor, and vibe.  The host and my bartender, Kenny, were fabulous!

Best I've ever had!\\n\\nPlease come check it out, ask for Kenny and also Octavio, the food runner (awesome, and sweet dude). \\n\\nCan't wait to come back!!!\", \"The food was great. The ambiance... whomever was in charge of design hit a home run. Fabulous without being pretentious. And the service *chef's kiss* Brandon was so lovely. I would return and sit in his section exclusively. He made my partner's birthday special and we were both grateful. We had a tight timeline because we were heading to a show and he managed the flow of our food perfectly. I wish we didn't have a tight timeline (my fault... A girl had to get ready lol) so that we could truly take it all in.\\n\\nWe'll be back :)\", 'Came for a friends birthday celebration for some drinks and bites. We got fries, smashed potatoes, chips and dip, wings and crab and cheese wontons. All apps were overpriced with the most egregious being the wontons (effectively crab rangoons) at $18 for 4 small pieces. I get NY prices but this was a bit much. All the apps tasted fine, the wings were the best. What we ordered and didn\\'t get because it didn\\'t make its way in was the tomahawk steak and a pasta. \\n\\nAmbience of the place was nice, filled with comfy cushioned velvet seats and dim lights. Music was not too loud. \\n\\nThe service is the reason for the two stars. When asked about the food, the waiter told us he never put it in and didn\\'t follow up. When we followed up on the order he told us \"that\\'s not how this works\". Our main waiter had to be chased down for simple things, had an attitude and seemingly ignored us when we would try to waive him down. Between that and the lack of apology for forgetting a large part of a dinner order, not sure we will be back.', \"Probably one of the best places I go to for whiskey options. \\n\\nLocated on 36th this place has a great vibe and an amazing decor. It gives you the feel of some place fancy. \\n\\nMy go to is whiskey (red breast 27) but I decided to try other things. Tonight I tried a tequilla old fashion .... It was pretty amazing. \\n\\nThe bar staff is very attentive to you even though it's busy.\", 'Beautifully decorated lounge with delicious cocktails! We came on Sunday of LDW without a reservation. The place was packed but we were able to get seats at the bar in 15 minutes. \\n\\nThe ambience is classy without being stuffy. Comfortable velvet chairs and walls covered in paintings. \\n\\nOur drinks were delicious. We tried the Game of Love, Dorians Temptation, The Raven (like an old fashioned), and the Catcher in the Rye (like a whisky sour). My favorites were Game of Love and Catcher in the Rye.

I didn't have a reservation (I was dining by myself, so I figured the wait wouldn't be too long) and I was able to get seated in around 10 min. But, the place really was quite busy, so I'd definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand.\\n\\nThe lunch menu is somewhat extensive and has so many well-priced, delicious option, so it was a bit hard to pick, but I ultimately decided on the bulgogi hotpot. Other than the main broth dish, it also comes with some side dishes that change daily, a salad, kimchi, rice, black sesame tofu, and potato salad.\\n\\nI don't know where to start this description exactly because each of the dishes was so delicious. Some highlights are the black sesame tofu - the tofu was so soft and fluffy, and the richer sesame-based sauce on top was a perfect complement to the tofu. The salad was really fresh and came with a wonderfully light dressing, and the side dishes (esp the potato salad) were similarly delicious across the board.\\n\\nAs for the main bulgogi pot, also fantastic. The beef was really tender and flavourful (as was the broth, of course), and it came with really generous portions of the meat itself and the glass noodles. The rest of the ingredients (onions, cabbage, courgette etc.) were all cooked really nicely. The broth was a bit too salty to drink by itself but tasted really good paired with some of the white rice.\\n\\nI really appreciated the variety of flavours between (and within!) each bite (honestly for the whole set overall, not just the hot pot specifically). Other than the visually-appealing harmony (the tray of food looks amazing), the flavour profile overall was just sooo delicious, with all the individually dishes complementing one another really well.\\n\\nDid I mention this was only $20 (plus tax/tip)? Honestly such a steal, and it's a shame I ordinarily don't have time to come by for weekday lunches !! I'd love to come again and try some of their other specials, but the regular/dinner menu looks fantastic, too - definitely will be back soon.\", \"I had been wanting to try Her Name is Han for so long and was excited to check out their brunch menu. I came here with a friend for the weekend brunch - make sure to make a reservation! We got there right on time for the reservation but still had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table. The restaurant is a decent size with tables that can seat anywhere from 2 to (what looked like) 8 people. It was a bit loud inside and (very minor inconvenience) my bench-type seating along the wall was a bit uncomfortable. \\n\\nThe brunch menu consists of some appetizers and set menus. The set menus are honestly a great deal! You get an entree with several banchans. I got the kimchi shakshuka and my friend got the mini budae-jjigae. The kimchi shakshuka was such an interesting take on the classic kimchi jjigae. There were lots of chunks of pork and it was so delicious. The budae-jjigae was what you'd expect it to taste like. \\n\\nI also got the peach blossoms cocktail - it was very refreshing but had a slightly artificial peach flavor...? Wasn't in an off-putting way though. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend this place for their brunch!\", \"Fantastic Korean restaurant that serves a variety of delicious and homey meals. We came at around 9pm on a Friday and were able to get a table right away. The interior is cozy with a rustic interior design: wooden tables and booths, brick walls. The service is ridiculously fast -- I think we got our dishes within 10 minutes of ordering. \\n\\n- banchan: refreshing and tasty -- the potato was my favorite. the kimchi had a more subtle flavor and was less fermented than I expected but I enjoyed how crunchy it was. \\n- slow cooked pork belly: this was fantastic. The pork had a great balance of fatty and lean meat, while also being tender but not chewy. You could also taste the smokiness. The jalapeno soybean paste added a slight spice -- great pairing. \\n- rice cakes: so many different flavors in a seemingly small dish! I really liked the  peppers and kabocha pieces on the top -- those were cooked down to a soft chew. the rice cakes were soft and had just the right amount of chew, and everything was evenly coated in the gochujang sauce. \\n- spicy seafood tofu hot pot: this was the perfect entree for a cold winter night. huge portion size with lots of seafood (clams, shrimp, crab), tofu chunks and pieces of onion and zucchini. The broth was spicier than I expected, so it did have quite a bit of a kick. \\n\\nI also wanted to give a quick note of appreciation to the staff: not only were they quick with the service, but also observant. at one point I was trying to remove some crab shell and a bit of the broth had dripped down my hand and without asking they came over and handed me extra napkins and wipes.\\n\\nFood was excellent and you'll leave happy and full.\", \"I've heard a lot about Her Name Is Han, and have always thought there are so many Korean spots in the city to get hold of wallet share. Because I'm not the biggest meat eater, we ordered the below:\\n\\nSpring Fling (Premium soju cocktail with cold infused lavender and elderflower)\\nHan Horchata (Housemade rice milk with cream, coffee liquor, cinnamon, and vanilla extract)\\nCrispy Kimchi Pancake\\nVeggie Tofu Hot Pot\\n\\nWhile we wanted to order the Spicy Seafood Tofu Hot Pot, our only qualm was that the broth was not able to be modified for non spicy, which we found odd assuming that this is not all pre-made. This is not a very vegetarian friendly restaurant as I found it hard to find a diverse amount of dishes to order. If you are still hungry and haven't ordered enough, I'd take a hike elsewhere to Venchi/Grace Street as their limited menu of two desserts left us scratching our heads.\", \"My husband and I have been here twice in the last 2 years for dinner and we are always dreaming about their galbi hot pot. It's so comforting, clean and delicious, and the beef so meaty. The broth doesn't leave us feeling thirsty so you know it's legit and not heavy on the msg.\\n\\nOn our last visit I got the veggie hot pot to be healthy and that one was homey as well but lacking the same kind of depth and richness of the beef broth. I was still grateful it lasted me about 3 meals (portion is huge!) I threw in noodles the next day at home and it was great. The japchae was more of a cold noodle salad, similar to a Vietnamese style vermicelli bowl with grilled meat on top - not what I was expecting but still good and refreshing. \\n\\nService is always great here. Would love to try the raw crab next time (or just return for the galbi hot pot).\", \"Her Name is Han is easily one of the coziest and most welcoming Korean restaurants I've been to in Manhattan. The vibe is super homey, with warm lighting and rustic touches that make you feel like you're dining in someone's kitchen. The staff was incredibly friendly and made the whole experience even better.\\n\\nThe food was amazing. My absolute favorites were the japchae and the Korean fried chicken. The japchae had perfectly chewy glass noodles with a deliciously savory-sweet sauce and fresh vegetables--it was so well-balanced and satisfying. The fried chicken was crispy, juicy, and packed with flavor, with a glaze that was sweet, tangy, and completely addictive.\\n\\nWe also tried the rice cakes, which were chewy and coated in a bold, spicy sauce. The garlic-marinated chicken was another standout--super tender with just the right amount of garlicky goodness. The scallion pancake was exactly what you'd hope for: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and loaded with fresh scallions. For drinks, I had the Spring Fling cocktail, which was light, citrusy, and refreshing--a perfect match for all the bold flavors of the food.\\n\\nIf you're craving Korean comfort food in a cozy spot, Her Name is Han is a must-visit. Everything we tried was packed with flavor, and I'll definitely be back for more japchae and fried chicken!\", 'TL;DR: Not worth the hype. Small portions, high prices, long wait (need reservations), and not necessarily authentic Korean cuisine.\\n\\nWow, I am not a fan of Her Name is Han. While the interior is  offers a cool western/ new frontier vibe (remaining me of Fallout, the game), the food and service leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThe bibimbap is nothing special but the portion is small for the high price you pay. The lunch sets with fish or the fish/seafood soup has very small portions for a very high price, and the flavors are not particularly authentic nor good in a new way. Even the kimchi that we got was way too soft, likely because it was left to ferment too long. The rice was even dry.', \"We came on Friday for dinner and it's a perfect spot to hangout with friends. The atmosphere was lively and the flavors were incredible. Reservations are highly recommended as they get really busy. \\n\\nThe fried code is a must order, with its thin, crispy skin and juicy fish inside, complemented by a dipping sauce that balanced the dish. We also tried the corn cheese croquette, tender slow-cooked pork belly, seafood pancake and army stew - each dish were amazing and our group enjoyed everything. \\n\\nRemember to leave room for dessert: the Spring Garden (black sesame ice cream with green tea biscuit crumbs) and the Han tiramisu were the perfect sweet ending to this great meal.\", \"Make a reservation on Resy. Well worth it. \\n\\nIt's a small place but very speedy service. \\n\\nWe got the bulgogi bibimbap and the chicken noodle soup. I highly recommend the chicken noodle soup!! The broth flavor is out of the world. The entire bowl tasted so unique. \\n\\nThe bibimbap was fresh but wasn't anything super unique. They could've given a little bit more meat. The portion is huge too but it is a lot of rice. \\n\\nSide dishes were unique ... loved them!\", 'I had high expectations for this restaurant, given all the buzz and glowing recommendations.\\n\\n * The raw marinated crab was a solid choice--well-marinated and flavorful.\\n * The crispy kimchi pancake with a poached egg was enjoyable, though I was expecting more mozzarella and a satisfying cheese pull, which was missing.\\n * The slow-cooked pork belly (bossam) was just average, something I could have easily skipped.\\n * The Korean fried chicken lacked flavor and was somewhat bland.\\n * The galbi, while good, was slightly overcooked and a bit dry.\\n * The rice cake hotpot was comforting, with a nice balance of spice.\\n\\nFor dessert, the Spring Garden black sesame ice cream was decent, though the dried strawberry felt unnecessary. The Han tiramisu was also underwhelming and could have been skipped.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was just okay--nothing memorable, and the restaurant felt overrated.\"', \"We came here at 5:30pm on a Thursday night and there was already a line out the door waiting for the restaurant to open! I'm glad we got a reservation and would recommend it. \\n\\nThe servers were really kind. They gave us a table that accommodated a stroller. The restaurant had a classy but cool vibe. And even though the restaurant was packed the whole night, they never rushed us. \\n\\nI liked that the menu was different from many other Korean restaurants in the area. We ordered tofu with black sesame dressing (my personal favorite), pork belly, spicy kimchi pancake, and a seafood hotpot (which had a surprising sweet tomato soup base). The tastes of these dishes were subtle, but it was clear that the chefs paid attention to the details and each dish was made with quality ingredients. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the tiramisu ice cream and black sesame ice cream with matcha biscuits. I personally liked the tiramisu ice cream because it was a cool take on the dessert, but my friend liked the contrasted textures of the other one. Again, subtle flavors but all so good!\", \"I have been hearing recommendations for this place and always wanted to check it out. It didn't disappoint me.\\nThe decorative interior which is subtle yet modern. Service is quick and efficient.\\nFood wise: I love their fried chicken, corn croquettes, pancakes and bibimbap.\\nFresh out of the kitchen and tasty. \\nI think that they made some twists to westernized but I would go back still.\", \"We ended up here by complete accident; we thought we were going to Take 31 and mistakenly entered the wrong door. However, we were seated so quickly that we didn't have time to notice. This experience confirmed my belief that some of the best restaurants are discovered by chance, and the best food often comes from places you stumble upon. This meal was magical. The ambiance was dark and cozy, featuring rustic cloth booths and dim mood lighting. The service was kind and quick, entirely unpretentious. There were two or three waiters who took care of our table throughout the night, making us feel like we were at a friend's home, invited over for a home-cooked meal.\\n\\nThe food was great. The menu, which features Korean-American fusion dishes, was reasonably priced, with entrees ranging from $20 to $30 (there are some outliers, of course, if you want to spend a little less or splurge). They start you off with complimentary side dishes, including some of the best kimchi we've had in NYC. For appetizers, we ordered dumplings, croquettes, rice cake, and shrimp pancake. Everything was delicious, but if we had to do it over again, we would recommend the rice cakes and shrimp pancakes--truly phenomenal.\\n\\nFor mains, we split the sweet and sour fried rice, beef bulgogi, and fried chicken. In the best way, the fried chicken tasted like an elevated McDonald's chicken nugget: perfectly battered, crispy, and golden brown with juicy white meat, all served with spicy ketchup. The bulgogi came on a sizzling skillet and melted in your mouth. The fried rice was also quite good--very sweet with large chunks of chicken breast. However, I would probably skip this dish next time in favor of more adventurous offerings like the sweet potato noodles. But who doesn't love fried rice?\\n\\nWe left Her Name is Han feeling stuffed, but we loved every bit of it. What felt most special was the intentionality behind everything--from the storytelling menu to the cozy seating--which made the food feel personal and inviting. 5/5 stars\", 'So quick to get a table.  Super reasonable and yet delicious. \\n\\nWe ate everything plus take home.\\n\\nIt js quality Korean food', \"Food \\nService \\nAmbiance \\nSo pleasantly surprised to have found this after we were able to enjoy 'Hells Kitchen' on Broadway.\\nThis was an outstanding culinary experience. Highly recommend.\", 'Feeling conflicted about this place because there were pros and cons to each factor. For example, the interior was cute but it was overwhelmingly warm in the store. The food was yummy, but costed around $25 per dish for very simple ingredients. The service was fast, though. The dessert was my favorite thing, with their black sesame ice cream, homemade matcha biscuit crumbs, and dried strawberries. That was one of my favorite eats on this trip! The price just deters me from wanting to come back often.', \"Great place and great food. Dishes are meant to be shared. \\n\\nDef get the spicy marinated blue crab, Black Sesame tofu since they were executed so well. \\n\\nYou can get the galbi short ribs, fried fish, army stew but they are as expected. \\n\\nYou can skip the bulgogi. Just wasn't anything special.\", \"I loved this place! My friend and I went here at 2pm on a weekday and got seated within 5 minutes. It was packed and despite them closing soon, they were still very attentive.\\n\\nThe food was great! We got:\\n1. Spicy Salmon Bibimbap (4/5): Super good and flavorful. I loved all the sides dishes that each dish came with. It was a very satisfying meal. The only thing I would say is that the rice to salmon ratio is a bit off, but nothing crazy.\\n2. Beef bulgogi (4/5): Also super good and flavorful. It was juicy and not dry. I liked this dish, but it didn't really stand out to me compared to all the other unique dishes they have.\\n3. Black sesame ice cream with matcha biscuit & strawberry bits (5/5): My friend and I LOVED this dish. It was the highlight of our whole trip. The ice cream was smooth and creamy and the slightly sweet crunch bitter matcha biscuit and tart strawberry bits complimented it so well!\\n\\nThe ambiance is super cute and calming in there! It's a cozy place with just enough seating.\", 'Waited ~30 minutes on a Saturday afternoon right before their mid-day close. Staff is really nice and attentive. They have a different menu for brunch I believe, and ordered the raw salmon bibimbap. Super tasty and came with a decent portion of banchan (Korean side dishes).', \"I have been back to this restaurant multiple times since my initial review years upon years ago. While I preferred the old lunch specials and the fact that the portion sizes like almost every other place has shrinkflation, the food here is still tasty and there's a reason why it's extremely popular. I had a seasonal apple cocktail which was good with a bit of alcohol but not too much and a good amount of sweetness but it wasn't cloying. They gave us a bunch of mini banchan and they were tasty as per usual with there being a potato salad, bracken, some type of green (I believe marinated cabbage,) and a wintery kimchi with my favorite being the bracken with the greens being nice and nutty as well.\\n\\nFor appetizers/smaller plates, they were out of the fried cod which has maesaengi tartar sauce and surprisingly the sesame tofu so instead we got the Spicy Rice Cakes/Tteokbokki with kabocha and shishito and paid a bit less per person which was tasty as always though as noted much smaller than it used to be. The Crispy Shrimp Pancake with said shrimp & hot pepper was tasty. The jeon had a good texture and there was plenty of plump shrimp inside of it.\\n\\nFor larger plates if you have a group, I would stick to getting the larger stews/jjigae and hot pots/jeongol as the other dishes aren't as good. The Sweet & Sour Chicken Fried Rice was pretty bland outside of light flavor from the gochujang and there wasn't much chicken in it and while the Spicy Grilled Pork Japchae with sweet potato noodles with marinated grilled pork, pickled radish, mixed greens & Thai chili pepper with Korean soybean sauce had well flavored pork, the portion was a bit small and it was a bit hard to combine the slippery noodles with the pork. \\n\\nThe Galbi Hot Pot with simmered galbi, napa cabbage, lotus root & assorted mushrooms in a soy sauce veggie broth was massive and tasty. The broth wasn't overly sweet which was appreciated and I believe there were some glass noodles on the bottom which helped soak up some of the excellent broth. The galbi was very tender and the mushrooms were tasty as well. The couple of slices of kabocha squash on top was a nice touch. Better was the Kimchi Jjim with homemade kimchi, pork ribs, squash & tofu in veggie broth. The broth had a good earthiness with some spice from the kimchi but not too much. The pork ribs fell off the bone and were very well flavored and overall it was quite tasty. \\n\\nA bit of a short review as we couldn't get two of the dishes but the food was tasty as per usual. It's a bit closer to a 4 than a 5 than the other times but I would still go here or to their sister restaurant Take 31 next door if you're looking for a more reasonably sized portion of said stews and excellent pork.\", \"I loved Her Name is Han! The flavors were all new and experimental but still kept the same homey Korean comfort that I look for in Korean cooking.\\n\\nWe started with the bossam which was so juicy and delicious. The Napa that comes with it was a little vinegar-y and paired nicely with the samjang and pork. Perfect texture bite- crunchy and juicy.\\n\\nThe Korean fried chicken was very tender and crispy! Didn't feel heavy at all. The sauce was a little too much for me but the chicken itself was delicious.\\n\\nThe yuzu noodle soup was an amazing dish. It was the perfect blend of citrus and creamy from the chicken soup broth. The flavor was like nothing I've had before! Delicious.\\n\\nI shared all three of these dishes with my roommate and made a reservation beforehand (recommended). I think you'd have to wait a long time if you don't make a reservation. Service was great and I will definitely be back for their weekend brunch menu.\", 'THE KIMCHI JIGAE ALTERED MY BRAIN CHEMISTRY-- the soup had depth and complexity of flavor that I attribute to the anchovy stock base. Kabocha (which I wish there was more of!) was soft and sweet. And the pork ribs-- so tender and much more flavorful than expected.\\n\\nMy first time trying saeujang but it did not disappoint. The fried shrimp heads bursting with flavor were delicious. The shrimp itself was firm and had a 糯唧唧 texture, but was marinated a little too long and needed more citrus. Kimchi jeon was ok, needed more salt, crispier edges, and less time on the fire, but delicious nonetheless.', \"Came here for the lunch set. The side dishes were so yummy. \\n\\nI'm glad I found a place where I can get an army stew that isn't sized for 4 people. One of my favorite dishes.\", \"I had been looking forward to trying Her Name is Han for a while, as I had heard rave reviews about this trendy Korean spot in Midtown. It definitely lives up to the hype! The food is authentic and flavorful. Between 5 people, we shared the army stew, LA galbi plate, pork belly, veggie hot pot, and seafood pancake which all came out hot within 15 minutes of ordering! The portions run on the larger size and individual bowls of white rice are included. For parties of 5+ a gratuity of 20% is included so just be aware! Seating can also take a while despite the $5 per person deposit on Resy- we got there at 7:55 for an 8pm reservation but weren't seated until closer to 8:15.\", \"This spot is always packed and busy, just like all of the staple Hand Hospitality restaurants. So my friend and I took a chance after a work event at 9PM on a weekday, which seems like the best time to get a table without a wait. Although they close at 9:45PM, the staff members are kind enough not to rush you out, so props to them for that.\\n\\nFor drinks, I tried the Han Horchata ($16) which is made from housemade rice milk with cream, coffee liquor, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Pretty decent if you're into drinks like espresso martini.\\n\\nThe Shrimp & Pepper Pancake ($16) is usually a great way to start off a meal. It comes with a dipping sauce, which I personally don't find it to be an enhancer. We also ordered the Beef Bulgogi Bibimbap ($19), which consists of 5 kinds of seasoned vegetables & egg yolk over rice. It is a classic Korean dish served in a hot stone and you mix everything in the bowl (without burning yourself). Great for sharing with a group of friends.\", \"Gee whiz. What an experience. It's worth the wait and worth making an reservation. Pookie and I came here on the whim as suggested by my fellow Yelp Eliter, and I'm glad we came. The restaurant was packed, but we were fortunate enough to have snagged a seat, after waiting about 15 minutes for a late lunch. The restaurant was bustling and slightly loud. I ordered the grilled akta mackerel set, and pookie ordered a beef bulgogi hot pot. The presentation is everything. The portions is perfect. Better yet, it made me feel like a superhero for eating everything on the food pyramid. We left here feeling satisfied for hours. Highly recommend Her Name is Han.\", \"I enjoyed this a lot!!  We got several dishes as pictured.  The best was the Bibimbap\\n5 Kinds of seasoned vegetables & egg yolk over rice with Beef bulgogi  $19.  It was worth every penny and had amazing flavors.  \\n\\nWe also got Spicy Grilled Pork Japchae $19\\nSweet potato noodles with marinated grilled pork, pickled radish, mixed greens & Thai chili pepper with Korean soybean sauce.  The meat was cooked in an amazing way and had so much flavor. But the whole dish just lacked the overall flavor from the other dish.  Good but not amazing.  I would not order again because I'm sure there are better options.  \\n\\nThis was very good but filling.   Mung Bean Pancake with Pork and Fern $16\\nKorean crispy pancake with mung bean, pork and fern. \\n\\nGreat lively atmosphere.  We didn't have a reservation, but it was very packed for a Tuesday night. We put our name down and they called us about 20 minutes later. We tried to book online, but it said there were no spots available. So we just showed up and took a chance and it worked out.\", 'Went to Her Name is Han with a friend with a reservation and had a good time! We got one a hot pot and pork belly to share. The food was delicious! The pork belly was full of flavor and melted in my mouth. The banchan was plentiful and offered refills when asked. \\n\\nWas a bit frustrated that we had to wait even with the reservation, but overall pretty good service. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made good recommendations. Restaurant was busy for a weekday but had a great atmosphere.', 'Excellent korean food. Waited for an hour without reservations. \\nI dont think this place needs more reviews.  Just order family style and dig in!\\n\\nKorean fried chicken - As good as they come. \\nRice cakes - Such an elevated version of such a simple dish. 100% recommend. \\nGarlic grilled chicken - Perfectly cooked and flavoured. \\nSpicy pork BBQ - Another excellent dish. \\nBudae Hot Pot - Unique experience where you get to taste a bunch of different things.', \"Got the Yuzu Kalguksu, bossam, and Korean fried chicken.  Yuzu Kalgusu was the star of the show- the yuzu provided a unique twist to the traditional soup. Bossam melts in your mouth. Chicken was good, but not my favorite thing on the menu. \\n\\nPrices were on the higher end. Servers were great\\n\\nRealllyyy loud inside w everyone talking. Not too great of a spot if you're trying for an intimate spot to talk. \\n\\nWorth a try!\", 'We went during lunch time for their lunch menu and got seated pretty quickly. This place is relatively packed during lunch time. The lunch menu was really good and worth it. We bibimbap which was a big portion especially with the appetizers on the side as well. The side dishes were super tasty. The tofu was pretty good with a black sesame sauce. The bibimbap was super flavorful and delicious. The budae hotpot was really tasty and packed with a lot of ingredients. Overall the lunch menu is extremely worth it and you get a good serving portion.', 'Delicious Korean foods with a lot of options. I loved their soup which had flavorful yet light soup base and a lot of meat and veggies! It is more fancy than your regular Korean restaurant in ktown but they have a great twist on Korean food which elevates your traditional dishes. Service was friendly and quick service. Ambiance is warm and comforting.', \"Went for lunch with a friend, and it was so good! Reminds me of spots you would get in Seoul. We booked our spots a few days in advance for Saturday afternoon lunch, and I would definitely recommend getting a reservation - there was a line / decent wait time for those who didn't make a reservation.\", \"Definitely worth the price for everything an entree comes with. Seating is a little tight but that's to be expected in nyc. Usually super crowded and long wait, but I happened to come at an off time when it was about to close between lunch and dinner (around 2pm)\", \"Did not make a reservation here, but stood in front of the restaurant before it opened and I was the first in line. Visited while traveling and I saw this place as a recommendation for Korean food. \\nI thought the chicken thighs were very good as the meat was super moist and tender. It paired well with the sauce, mushrooms and asparagus. The other dishes I tried was the seafood pancake. This dish did not impress me much. It had too much dried fish taste and it was oily yet dry. \\nThe army stew came with a small fire  to keep it hot. It wasn't the best I had as the kimchi in the dish was made of regular cabbage. \\nI also had a little cocktail with apple in it. It was a delicious and refreshing drink. \\n\\nThe restaurant filled up very quickly so I suggest getting here 5 minutes prior to open.\", \"We lined up as soon as the doors opened because we decided on a whim to go here. It's a very cozy and intimate spot, good for date nights or a catch up session with a girlfriend :). \\n\\nWe got their rice cakes and the slow cooked pork belly (small). Honestly, we both don't have the biggest stomachs, so the portion size was good, but I think otherwise it's pretty expensive for the amount you get. It's good though! But the amount of rice cakes you get is crazy LOL. If you have a bigger appetite, I definitely think you would need to order more than 2 dishes. \\n\\nWe unfortunately had to leave before dessert, but I would love to come back and try their black sesame ice cream.\", \"Was lucky enough to score a seat without a reservation on a Saturday night for a few quick bites. Service was fast, prompt, and friendly. It's a well lit, well decorated, clean location in k-town\\n\\nBanchan was interesting and non-typical. The gochujang dried squid was great- fishy, sweet, and chewy. Mashed potato's were sweet and mild, the kimchee was light and bright, and the leeks and seaweed were fresh and crisp. Overall very light but flavorful. 4.5/5\\n\\nThe tteokbokki was seared perfectly, and had an ideal texture. The sauce was a bit sweet and flat, it could have used a bit more of a kick. The veggies didn't add much to the dish, and we would have preferred more of the perfectly cooked rice cake instead. 4/5\\n\\nThe chicken wings had perfect texture and breading- the darker meat was wonderfully juicy and rich, and the breading was perfectly crispy. However, the sauce provided was (again) a bit one note and too sweet for us. We would have preferred more sauce options, or for a more heat-forward sauce. 3.5/5\\n\\nThe pork japchae was probably the best dish we had- pork had a great Smokey flavor and good charred bits, the noodles were well seasoned and spiced, and the pickled daikon brought everything together with a sharp, vinegary bite. The serving size was also enormous for the price. Highly recommend getting this dish. 5/5\", \"I showed up a little after noon and was seated right away.\\n\\nI had such high hopes but sadly their food was ok. Every banchan was bland and unmemorable, including kimchi. And no refills. I judge Korean restaurants based on their banchan so I won't go back.\", \"The quality of Her Name Is Han seems to be slipping more and more every time I go. \\n\\nThe most recent time I went was a Tuesday evening at 5:30 PM with a friend. We made a reservation beforehand so we were seated right away. I highly recommend making a reservation beforehand since the restaurant does fill up quickly. \\n\\nService itself was very good. They are always very efficient and attentive since there always seems to be someone around to help with anything you need. \\n\\nWe ordered and shared: \\n\\nASPARAGUS AND LEEK NAMUL WITH POACHED EGG: It was a very interesting combination and just ok. A bit homogenous in texture and just kinda disappointing. \\n\\nFRIED COD: The cod was very well fried but the flavor was a bit bland. The Tartar sauce it came with though was very tasty and really complimented the fish well. \\n\\nCORN AND CREAM CROQUETTES: I love their croquettes so much. This is a must order! \\n\\nMUNG BEAN PANCAKE WITH PORK AND FERN: Flavor was pretty bland and I could barely taste any pork. They are really expecting the soy sauce on the side to carry the flavor. \\n\\nGALBI: Wow, their galbi was perfectly grilled and so flavorful and tasty. There's also a good amount of rendered fat to meat ratio. The three small thin slices of mushroom on the side and greens though were not that good. Would have been nice if there was more meat provided especially for a cost of over $30. \\n\\nFinally, the banchans they served were very hit or miss. The kimchi was not even fully fermented, flavor was super bland and disappointing. The string beans and pork (?) was marinated well but the meat was so dry. But I do have to say that the potato salad was so tasty and my favorite. I did find it weird though that even though I wanted to just get a refill on the potato salad they would bring a full set of all of the dishes out so we ended up with a couple plates of the banchan we did not like and wouldn't eat. Seems like a waste that could be avoided. \\n\\nAll in all, it has been disappointing to see the quality of Her Name is Han slipping over the years but they do still have some gems on their menu.\", \"We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for three, but it was worth it! The restaurant is really dark, so it's kind of hard to see the food, but the food is GOOD. The kimchi pancake was crispy and flavorful, although we had to ask for the soy sauce to go with it (10000% recommend). We got a soup with galbi in it that was very good. The galbi fell of the bone and the soup was filled with veggies. We also got bossam that was good, but nothing special. Service was attentive. The place is a bit pricey, but the quality is there. Overall, would come back if I made a reservation. S\", \"We were looking for Korean fried chicken and chose her name is Han based on reviews and luckily were able to get a reservation calling on the same day. They also accept walk ins. \\n\\nThe ambiance was very cute and good for a date night too. Service was prompt and the food came out pretty quickly!\\n\\nThe KFC was a disappointment but everything else was amazing. If you was KFC I'd go somewhere else, we've had better elsewhere. The three appetizers we got were our favorites. The fried cod pieces were so flavorful and a great texture. The asparagus dish was delicious and a good vegetable to offset all the fried food we ordered. The pancake appetizer we got was also very flavorful. So much on the menu looked appetizing that I was interested in trying as well! They had one cocktail that could be made into a mock tail.\", 'Everything about Her Name is Han screams \"home.\" From the cozy aesthetic that draws you in to the friendly, attentive service given from everyone there. Our server was very mindful of my food allergy and informed me what I can and can\\'t have which not only helped with food selection but also made me feel like family.\\n\\nFood tasted authentic and was extremely delicious. Portions were more than enough, definitely enough to share amongst a group of friends if you order a couple things together. The only reason I am taking a star off is because I was told if I ordered the large portion of the pork belly then I would receive a side of rice with the dish, but I never got it.\\n\\nOverall tho, a great dinner experience! Wouldn\\'t mind coming back here during my next trip to NYC!!', 'I arrived 10 minutes before opening on a Saturday evening, and the line was quickly forming so I figured, \"This place must be amazing!\" \\n\\nThe service was outstanding; there were plenty of servers and every time we needed something, we received it instantly. It is very dim inside, creating a more intimate atmosphere -- great for a date, though it can be crowded.\\n\\nThe seasoning for everything tasted a bit off for me. For the side dishes, the kimchi was bland, while the beef was salty. For the mains, the bulgogi was fine but nothing spectacular, and the budae hot pot was also bland. The portion size for the bulgogi was small for the price.\\n\\nOverall, I\\'m a bit disappointed because I had high expectations that were not met.', \"4.5 / 5.0 - I came to Her Name Is Han for lunch with coworkers and we could see why it's so popular.\\nThey have a cool, stylish decor, excellent service and tasty food.\\n\\nI ordered the Beef Bulgogi Hot Pot ($20+), which has clear veggie broth with beef bulgogi, noodles, zucchini, mushroom, onions & bok choy.\\n\\nFor lunch, all of their hot pots are served with white rice, mixed green salad, 3 side dishes, salad kimchi, potato salad and topping tofu.\\nI loved having the variety of flavors from the different dishes and it was quite filling.\\n\\nCan't wait to try more dishes next time!\", 'Generous portions, amazing service, great ambiance. What more could you ask for? Probably one of my favorite dining experiences in NYC.\\n\\nMy friend and I came to Her Name is Han during a winter day.

We ordered a few dishes to try amongst ourselves which were the corn and cream croquettes, crispy kimchi pancake, slow cooked pork belly, and the yuzu chicken noodle soup. Everything was AMAZING!! I have nothing more to say than that and would most definitely come back. It's no wonder there is always a long wait to get seated!!!\", \"Popular but for all the right reasons. The space is cool, trendy and comfortable. Perfect for our weekday lunch of 4. They didn't take any reservations so we showed up right at 12PM when they opened their doors (with a line already forming) and hoped for the best. Luckily, we were seated right away! \\n\\nWe shared a bunch of apps and everyone got one of the lunch dishes as their entree. The corn croquettes were definitley the table favorite, soooo deliciously creamy and flavorful and just really good. We also got fried mushrooms and the korean fried chicken. A little heavy on the fried food but when you are just nibbling on a little of everything, why not? \\n\\nFor my entree, I got the Grilled Atka Mackerel. The fish was perfectly crispy and so good, but the real show stopper for me were all of the little sides. From rice to soup, tofu, potato salad, a green salad, kimchi and more. They were all so good. I am not usually a tofu fan but whatever sauce they had on it was delicious. The four trays of food took up the entire table. \\n\\nI had some hot tea to digest and then took myself on a long walk around the city. I'll definitely recommend this spot and can't wait to check it out again for brunch or dinner.\", \"NYC ktown - took the subway to ktown and explored and decided to try out this restaurant we saw on Yelp coz it didn't look like your ordinary Korean restaurant. So glad we tried it!\\n\\nTheir lunch combos were very affordable. For $20 we got a bunch of sides, soup and main dish. In comparison the $28 soy marinated shrimp was such a poor deal - and we didn't enjoy it either because it's too much soy sauce flavor. But if that's what you like then I think they did a good job. If they marinated in salt and some other seasoning it would've made it better.\\n\\nI got the chicken noodle soup combo and my hubs got the garlic chicken combo. Their mashed potato banchan was super delicious! Their kimchi was watered down and I definitely had better ones elsewhere. I wish my noodles were a little more chewy. Seems like they got softened in the soup quite quickly. The soup itself was nourishing and the shreds of chicken breast were edible. On the other hand, the garlic chicken was bomb - so much garlic flavor, love it!\\n\\nWe also enjoyed the croquette. Good thing we got 3 pieces instead of 2. It's very creamy and savory with good seasoning.\\n\\nThe ambiance is hip and lively. We saw some young people but also office workers having lunch here on a weekday. \\n\\nService was prompt and friendly. No wait when we walked in around noon on a weekday.

From the mezze, my favorite was the fattoush which was so colorful and flavorful, I kept going back for more.  The hamachi is also excellent.    The dessert cheesecake is something different and so good. \\n\\nOverall great experience.

This definitely made our experience so much more enjoyable. They did not rush us and made sure we had time to look at the menu, they explained it and gave us so much time to eat and chat. \\n\\n1. Dips (8/10): favorite were the hummus and the eggplant. loved that it came with both vegetables to dip and warm bread\\n2. Hamachi (7/10): It was good but not something I would come back and get\\n3. Octopus Carpaccio (6/10): Similar to hamachi, it was good but the texture of the octopus threw me off\\n4. Hot Kasseri Cheese (7/10): bread that was paired with this was delicious but the cheese was underwhelming and I enjoyed eating the bread with the dips instead\\n5. Golden Beets (7/10): Solid had a great flavor\\n6. Grilled Branzino (5/10): It was tiny but came with a whole head of lettuce. Not worth the price. Char on it was fine but no flavor on the fish\\n7. Zou Zou's Duck Borek (9/10): probably our favorite dish, super flaky but had a strong flavor inside. overall super unique and definitely a must get\\n8. Fire-roasted leg of lamb (8/10): It was a lot bigger than you'd expect. Can feed up to 5-6 people, came with two dips, bread and veggies. Lamb had parts that were delicious but other parts were overdone. I was a bit disappointed given the high price point of the dish ($130)\\n9. Charred Broccoli (6/10): Very saucy and made the broccoli squishy, a little too charred \\n10. Crispy Latkes (9/10): Crispy and perfect as a side\\n11. Kataifi Cheesecake (9/10): Loved the topping, it complimented the inside very well. Had a nice touch with the walnuts. Overall eating it was delicious\\n12. Charred Pineapple (10/10): Such a underrated dish. This was amazing and so well done. They added extra flavors and it was perfectly smoky. Definitely coming back for this. \\n\\nThe drinks were also delicious and really paired well with the meal. It is so beautiful inside, it is super clean and super easy to get to. I would definitely recommend it, if you are in the area.

We devoured all of the dishes.\\n\\nI especially loved the branding of their menu, and to-go orange and gold foil bags. A designer's eye candy. \\n\\nZou Zou's has a great ambiance and ample space for big or small parties. Now that I've tried the indoor and outdoor dining I can definitely recommend this for anyone in the area.\", \"The favorite dish by far was the mezze spread - I would've been happy just dipping their pita bread into the mezze and having that be my entire meal.\\n\\nWe also savored the Brussels sprouts. I think the filet mignon kebab was okay. The duck borek felt way too decadent so it was the most unpopular dish. Lastly the cheesecake/kunefe dessert would've been great if the cream weren't so heavy/sweet.\", \"A beautifully designed and executed interior that is unfortunately not backed up by the service nor kitchen of Zou Zou's.

We ended up doing the chef's menu, because why not? \\n\\nThe starters were all really good. The green dip with the aquafaba on top was unreal! Nothing I've ever had. The hamachi was solid. The branzino was very flavorful. The meat kabob was our favorite. Wish there was more! It was so flavorful, tender, it literally melted in your mouth. The pineapple for dessert was not interesting to any of us. The kunafa cheesecake was really good though! Not as heavy as I thought it would be, very light. \\n\\nAmazing meal overall!\", \"A solid 3 stars for Zou Zou's. This is a late(ish) review, but better late than never, am I right? I came here after attending a nearby event as a recommendation by a passerby as he heard my friend and I chatting about finding a late night spot. Zou' Zou's he said!!! So we went. \\n\\nThe restaurant is very beautiful. Stunning even. It was very packed with all the tables full. Luckily, two seats were available at the bar.. which I feel are the best seats. We were able to watch the chefs put the dishes together.. kinda cool. We didn't want to have anything heavy, so we ordered the mezzo platter which was an array of dips, pita, veggies. I enjoyed 3/5, the roasted eggplant was my least favorite(I just can't get jiggy with it). The tahini and whipped ricotta was good. We didn't have any cocktails aside from a glass or two or prosecco. \\n\\nNice place, decent service, and good dips. Will I return, maybe if I'm in the area. The overall vibe, is not anything I tend to go for. I prefer a more laid-back vibe.\", 'A decent Mediterranean restaurant in NYC.

We luckily made reservations via OpenTable however the individuals/parties that walked in without a reservation were not able to grab a seat during lunch hour. \\n\\nWe ordered: \\n- Whipped ricotta dip with saffron apricots: so good \\n- Green Tahini dip w/aquafaba and cilantro: the cilantro dip tastes like an indian green chili/cilantro chutney, it was so good \\n- Smoked Carrot dip with hazelnuts and pomegranates: delish \\n- Golden Beet & Feta Mezze with citrus and chicory: the beets tasted good with the feta, but wasn't a fan of the citrus. This was my least favorite dish. \\n- Brussel Sprouts with honey and aleppo: this was alright\\n- Lemon Frozen Yogurt that has lemon shaved ice, frozen labneh and olive oil: the labneh and shaved ice were super sour, it was good but in small portions. This dessert is massive so I would recommend ordering it for the group rather than individually. \\n\\nThe restaurant is upscale and a nice atmosphere. The service was good.

There\\'s not many restaurants or foods that surprise me or blow my mind, but they managed to! \\n\\nI loved their \"cheesecake\" dessert.

Everything about it. The interior was beautiful. They had a cocktail lounge upstairs called chez zou and all the drinks were phenomenal. We opted to do the chef's menu because it included basically everything we wanted and the amount of food was insane. We were starving when we walked in and we were full halfway into the apps.\\nAll the dips were delicious and put a fun, new twist on classic mezze. Our favorite was the green tahini. We got 2 plates of gamchi because there were 4 of us. The fattoush had a fall twist to it that was delicious. My personal favorite app was the our manti; it was like a fried kebbeh dumpling on a plate of garlic labneh, so good. \\nSince there were 4 of us we got 2 Branzino that were fileted with grilled lettuce which is never tried but was very good, just hard to eat. The kebab was cooked perfectly. The duck borek was good but honestly so heavy, we barely made a dent in it. \\nOne of the best things that hit the table was the dessert. It was a mix of baklava, kunafa, and cheesecake and we couldn't stop eating it. \\nI would definitely come back and bring lots of friends!!\", 'The food was great and the staff was friendly and professional.

The meats, fish and vegetables put on the grill are so fresh with only light seasoning, so to preserve its original deliciousness. \\n\\nFrom the lamb on skewers , beef steak to the dip tower,  cocktails and more, we enjoyed every bite and had to order double orders of the steak. \\n\\nDespite how busy they were, the servers made rounds to check on us regularly, service was wonderful.\\n\\nWe walked to the restaurant since it is only several blocks from where we stayed, and subway entrance nearby, so not really sure about parking situation, also given we don't drive when in NYC. \\n\\nOur overall experience was very satisfactory & Highly recommended by @WineDinenVacay\", 'The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a great ambiance. However, I felt a bit let down by the food. The dips and bread was good, nothing special. The salad was over seasoned and way too salty. The chicken was quite yummy on its own. The service was great.', \"Although it's a beautiful restaurant, the service and food are positively awful.  Waiters were personable, but service was absolutely awful.  A full half hour went by before anyone even came to the table to take drink orders.  It was 1:30 on a Saturday Afternoon, and the restaurant wasn't even 3/4 full, and there were plenty of servers in the room.  Drinks took an additional 20 minutes to arrive, and despite three separate requests, water was not brought to the table until midway through the meal, the order for which was not taken until 20 minutes after drinks arrived.  When the water finally came, (and, sadly to say, begrudgingly delivered) the small glasses were half-filled and then never refilled again. \\n\\nThere was an extremely limited Brunch menu. 3  burgers were ordered,1 medium rare, 1 medium, and 1 medium well;  they took 30 minutes until they were served, and when they all came to the table, all three were rare.  We could send them back, as we could not find a waiter until a full 15 minutes after they arrived, and so, by that point, we decided to just cut our losses, as we feared the recooked burgers would take yet another half an hour, with no guarantee they would be at the desired temperatures or how long they would take to be served. \\n\\nAmbiance was lovely but the experience was unnecessarily dreadful.\", \"Very busy restaurant inside the Pendry hotel! Lots of hustle & bustle, great bar scene. I had the shishkabob and it was amazingly good! Christian enjoyed the baby lambchops. We had some wine and the bill was very large! $$$$ But it's NYC and it was a fun time!!!\", 'I recently ended up back at Zou Zou\\'s and had another amazing experience...that even included the same excellent server.  However, instead of sitting in the main dining room, my group was outside on the swanky patio.  I was also pleased to discover that the restaurant had a rooftop area that I will need to explore on my next visit.\\n\\nThe person that had organized the outing decided that it would be wise to order a few shareable plates to kick off our meal.  Again, I was dazzled by the creamy, zesty Dip Tower, featuring plates of apricot-topped whipped ricotta, black garlic chickpea, smoked carrot, roasted eggplant, and green tahini varieties, all paired with fluffy pita.  However, this time I also sampled the Lamb Tartare, which was sliced thin and more like a carpaccio.  The meat had been spiced with \"merguez flavors\", which I thought resembled cinnamon and/or five-spice.  The smooth, moist lamb was topped with bulgur wheat crumbles for some texture.  In addition, it was served with lettuce leaves to make your own wraps.  It was an unique and interactive dish.  \\n\\nFor my own meal, I selected one of their \"specialty\" plates, the Grape Leaf Sea Bass with its side of a tomato vinaigrette.  Essentially, I was tasked with peeling back the grape leaves and pouring the savory tomato broth over the insanely tender fish.  The dish was excellent, but the vinaigrette was essential to making it a really flavorful experience.  In addition to my main course, I had some of the delicious Wadi Rum Jeweled Rice from my last visit, but also got to try the Brussels Sprouts and Latkes.  The sprouts had been coated in honey and Aleppo seasoning, so they had a great taste, but they were a bit too charred, like the broccoli had been previously.  The potato pancakes, on the other hand, were excellent!  They were crispy, without being overly fried or greasy, and they contained a generous amount of onion.  \\n\\nMy only real negative feedback would be that my pot of Rishi-brand mint tea was served to me three times at a luck warm temperature.  Apparently, there had been an issue with their water heating system, so it took a few tries to finally receive it with the ideal amount of heat.  Once I finally approved it, I found the tea bursting with refreshing mint flavor.  \\n\\nAfter two successful visits to Zou Zou\\'s, I would definitely say that it has become one of my favorite restaurants!', 'Delicious dinner!! We reserved this restaurant for dinner not knowing it was in the lobby of our hotel so that was a nice surprise! \\n\\nThe cocktails were great, as was my glass of Tempranillo. For dinner, we opted to skip on the chefs tasting. We ordered the dips and oysters to start! All the dips were delicious with our favs being the ricotta and the tahini. The oystered were also very good and were really small east coasts. We got the sea bass and filet skewer for entrees and they were both incredible! We ended with the cheesecake. It was very good but probably could have done with the crunchies on top lol!\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come back to try more dishes!', 'Plenty of food here with a big menu and creative dishes. It is a Mediterranean restaurant with a modern twist. Tables are a bit close and dark ambiance. Service was friendly and average. \\n\\n1. Dips - We had a sampler for the dips and all were on point! Very different from each other. \\n\\n2. Crudo - Fresh and with a bit of spice\\n\\n3. Beet salad - Bigger salad than it looked and this satisfied our veggie craving\\n\\n4. Duck Borek - Also a big heavy dish. Great to split among a few friends. You can taste the orange in it. \\n\\nOverall, a good restaurant to come with friends and try at least once!', 'Lovely atmosphere, decent business lunch, we ordered many different dips highly recommend the ricotta, taziki and eggplant dip. The pita is A+, had the burger and fries as my entree which is great choice every time.', \"A short walk from the Javits Convention my coworkers and I were able to get a quick table, without a reservation, thanks to the host. \\n\\nWe enjoyed a mix of dips with vegetables and some great pita bread. I ordered the branzino and really enjoyed the dish along with some shared potato latkas on the side. Definitely a place I'd come back to visit.\", \"We got the dip platter which included a chickpea hummus, roasted eggplant with spice peppers, whipped ricotta with apricots, green tahini with aquafaba, and smoked carrot with pomegranate.\\n\\nThe eggplant and the carrot were my personal favorite, while others at the table really loved the whipped ricotta.\\n\\nWe also got the octopus carpaccio, which was tender, although a bit too tart for me.\\n\\nWe also tried the grilled artichokes, which had a nice roasted flavor. It's a bit cumbersome to eat, but was a nice things to snack on while chatting.\\n\\nFor mains, we got the duck borek, which was probably my favorite of the evening. It was nice and balanced with the orange.\\n\\nWe also tried the fire-roasted leg of lamb, which was tender and not too gamey. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but I was able to enjoy this.\\n\\nRounding it out, we had the jeweled rice, which was also a highlight for me. It had great flavors, although my only gripe is that it was quite oily.\\n\\nIn general, I've had better mediterranean food when looking at the individual dishes, but all in all, when considering their large menu, their great service, and really beautiful setting, it's a great place to take guests or large parties to try something new.\", \"Food is unreal. Can't describe all the flavors. The Chef's Menu is the way to go. Be prepared to take food home, the portions are generous. Service is very friendly and efficient. Fun modern energetic vibe to enjoy your meal in.\", 'The food is absolutely delicious here! We came for a late dinner around 8/8:30pm on a Tuesday and it was busy. There was a minor wait but it ended up to be totally worth it. The food is so unique and flavorful. The lamb tartar was seasoned so well and the bulgur added a nice crunch to balance our the texture of the lamb. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The buttermilk and onions added such a complimentary taste to the chicken. Simply amazing. Then the filet mignon! Ugh... So tender and cooked to perfection. The sauce paired really nicely with the natural flavors of the beef. Would totally come back to have these dishes again and try others. This is definitely a great date night spot!', 'This restaurant is beautiful, ambiance is classy, and the service is lovely.\\n\\nI would not dine here with picky eaters as the dishes all seemed to have a twist incorporating creative flavors into what you would traditionally expect- we had a picky eater in the group.\\n\\nOtherwise the experience is delightful utilizing unexpected flavors and the service is excellent', \"Great vibe, everyone seems happy. We stopped in after ice skating outside in the winter. Drink presentation is amazing. Beautiful glasses, perfect Instagram photo ops. All the good looks yummy. Great friendly n courteous service. I'll have to\\nCome back to try other things.\", 'Oh Zou Zous, you have my heart! Everything was literally so beautiful here - from the ambiance and chic decor to the way the food is presented! Ordered their most popular dip tower and pistachio babka and they certainly did not disappoint. Loved all the options on the dip tower and it tasted very fresh, the bread that comes with it is warmed, thick and fluffy. \\nThe babka is basically dessert, probably enough to feed 6-8 ppl! Sweet, citrusy, and nutty. The lemon butter is certainly not needed but a delightful addition. We also ordered the chicken which I thought was delicious but nothing to write home about. \\nSangria was light, sweet and fruity. I loved how spacious the restaurant is and did not feel rushed to leave. Great place for brunch and catching up with friends!', \"Celebratory Dinner!!\\n\\nI chose Zou Zou's as the location for my nieces 39th bday. Reservations are easily made via OpenTable. We dined on a Saturday night with a 9pm reservation. Upon arrival we were told our table wasn't ready yet so we moved over to the bar area until we were called. Around 9:30 we were escorted to our table. \\n\\nUpon being seated our waitress came over for a drink order. I had a Field Trip which is the perfect refreshing drink for the mezcal/tequila lovers. For our food we shared everything starting with the Kasseri Cheese & Dips for our appetizers. Moving on to the Duck Borek and Fire Roasted Leg of Lamb. The Duck and lamb were the stars of the night. The lamb once cut could easily feed 6ppl the Duck was split into 4 slices. Both dishes were the absolute best of the best! Full of flavor, cooked to perfection and the presentations were amazing!!\\n\\nOut waitress checked on us throughout or meal making sure we were ok. The vibes were so lively, great overhead music, conversations all around plus many other birthdays being celebrated. At the end of our meal our waitress assisted in surprising my niece with the birthday cake I purchased. We sang happy birthday, made a toast and thanked everyone for a wonderful night!\\n\\nThe wait time for our table would've been a huge complaint for me BUT being at the bar enabled me to watch the bartender. She was truly a mixologist! I was amazed just watching her do her thing. The Field Trip that she made me was one of the top 5 cocktails I've ever had. \\n\\nZou Zou's passes the vibe check!!\", \"We brought my family to this restaurant for a special night out, and it did not disappoint! The service and staff were absolutely amazing, making our dining experience truly memorable. The sit us with a free glass of champagne to celebrate our wedding anniversary.\\n\\nWe decided to go with the Chef's pre-fixed menu, and it was an excellent choice. The portions were generous, easily enough to satisfy our group of 5-6 people. The highlight of the meal was the 5 dips appetizer--each one was delicious and unique. And don't even get me started on the cheesecake dessert; it was the perfect sweet ending to an incredible meal.\\n\\nHonestly, every dish we tried was fantastic. That said, be aware that the price is quite steep, so this is definitely a place for special occasions. It's the perfect spot to bring friends and family when you want to celebrate in style.\\n\\nThis restaurant is a gem for anyone who loves Mediterranean cuisine. Highly recommended!\", \"My new favorite restaurant in Manhattan West, I love this area of Hudson Yards. Zou zou is a vibe from the minute you walk in, beautiful, modern decor, dim lighting. I've been for both lunch and dinner. The also have a lounge upstairs which I have yet to go to.\\nFull bar, creative cocktail list. The spritz was light and refreshing.\\nThe dip tower is the way to go for a shareable appetizer, all the dips are good, served with pita & veggies.\\nFor entree my friend and I shared the branzino and chicken, both were very good, tasty, and cooked perfectly. Generous portions. The branzino was served with greens topped with a vinegar. The chicken came with a delicious sauce served in an onion peel, great presentation. We had Brussels sprouts as a side, also very good, a little charred. \\nOverall a great spot for any occasion.\", 'Really cool vibe, very nice atmosphere and the food was delicious. We tried the smoky broccoli which had a rich flavor and had crushed cashews, interesting seasoning made it a wonderful starter. Having seen it on tables as we walked through to be seated we got the lobster salad. I know - salad?! But the blend of fresh herbs in the creamy dressing that was just enough without overpowering. The presentation of the lobster coming on an oversized skewer with blistered cherry tomatoes was extra, in a good way. Would definitely recommend!', \"I've been here a handful of times and every time is 100/10. Easily my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious and the service is great. Definitely on the pricier side, we usually spend about $75/person but it gets you a ton of food.\", \"Has outdoor and indoor seating and it's lovely to sit outside in the summer. The sangria was delicious and so was the food. We got duck borek, manti and the spreads and kasseri cheese. Manti doesn't taste like a Turkish manti and isn't my favorite here but all the others were amazing. Kasseri cheese was simply amazing and so were the spreads. Service was good - they were decently attentive and brought food quickly. Highly recommend!\", \"We can here for lunch in a weekday. Everyone agreed that the food was very tasty and the service was very attention. The space is also decorated beautifully. It's a good spot for an event\", \"Such a great restaurant with beautiful decor. We got the chefs special which was sooooo much food and great value for the money. I can't remember details on everything that we got but my favorites were the whipped ricotta, filet mignon, bronzino, bok choy, cabbage salad & the cheesecake! Highly recommend checking this place out for a date night or special occasion. Our server jimmy was awesome, he was very attentive and helpful!\", \"This was a great dining experience. My cousin and I decided to try it after singing it on Instagram we did the viral chef's menu. It was only two of us, but we did our best to eat everything I left there stuffed I was worried at the price at first, but you definitely get your moneys worth.. it was a great experience. Everything was delicious. The day we went. The restaurant was crowded, but I felt like we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. I would go back. This is great to do with friends or a date night.\", \"Honestly super surprised at how good the food was here, thought it was overhyped but everything was great. The ambiance was so nice and the drinks were really strong. We ordered the dips and it was so filling, everything was unique, the lamb dish was amazing and we also liked the chicken but the lobster we could've done without. The rice was also good but we definitely didn't need it. The octopus was fresh but we didn't like the sauce very much.\", \"***Decent Service, Lots of Seating, Pricey***\\n\\nI came here recently and definitely enjoyed what we ordered. I don't necessarily think it's something that I would come back to have again due to the price. Also, the service was a bit slow and it was after lunchtime hours.\", 'The service was outstanding. The waiter immediately approached us by saying \"I heard we\\'re celebrating today\"and brought us two glasses of champagne. It was our anniversary. The ambiance and aesthetics are perfect for pictures. The crowd was a mix of out of towners and people who were there after work. It\\'s a plus if you\\'re staying at the hotel. There is also Chez Zou, which is the upstairs lounge. We didn\\'t get to go because we are new parents and were exhausted by the time dinner was over. \\n\\nOK, so the dips. The dips were the best part of the dinner. I know that sounds insane but I am still drooling over the whipped ricotta! The green Tahini was a close second. The branzino was also great but I will say the jeweled rice was very overwhelming. There was just too many flavors at once and not something I would order again. We also ordered the Little gems and personally there was too much vinegar for my liking. \\n\\nI would definitely go back for the dips and to check out Chez Zou!', 'Came for lunch on Saturday with a group of 4. Ambiance was nice - more on the elevated side but still great for a casual lunch. We were seated about 15 minutes late for our reservation and they were kind enough to give us a complementary mezze tower. The dips were amazing with the chickpea (hummus), whipped ricotta, and eggplant being our favorites. We also shared manti which were a bit different than what we are used to being fried but they were delicious and the sun dried tomato and sauce added an extra layer of flavor. For our main, we shared the oysters and lobster Cobb. Oyster were phenomenal, so fresh! The lobster Cobb was also great- initially ours had no dressing for some reason so it was dry but we asked our server who brought us dressing and after that the salad was perfect. Lobster was juicy and well cooked. Also, our server Josh was so kind and helpful. We really enjoyed the lunch and would love to return to try out their dinner.', 'It is the best Mediterranean place in the area. I love their food. Service is always good. The atmosphere is nice, especially during the summer, because you can sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather!', \"My friend doesn't recommend the lobster. But the dips and wild rice were delicious! Our server was so awesome, as well. \\n\\nNice ambiance and space. Easy to get a last minute reservation here, too.\", \"Surprise in the middle of Hudson Yards - was delicious. Ambiance, food, and drinks were all 10 out of 10. Shout out to the chef, who I met and was the sweetest.\\n\\nMy two favorites were the whipped ricotta on their dips appetizer platter, and also their braised cabbage dish.\\n\\nAlso, it was my first time trying artichokes (I know, I'm a rookie ) but if that's how they are supposed to taste, my goodness! Insanely good.\\n\\nPS - I left my backpack there after dinner, and everyone was very helpful about the situation, picked it up next day. \\n\\nWill be back!\", \"Have been here twice with groups of 4. It's a vibrant ambience with amazing service. It's connected to the Pendry hotel. Food is top tier. \\nThe dip platter is a must! \\nFried chicken is good too but the portions are huge. \\nThe Duck Borek is more of a meat pie, with a cheesy flavor. \\nWould like to try the lamb chops or branzino in the future. \\nOverall really impressed with the new restaurant options by Manhattan West.\", 'Went to this place off of a recommendation from tiktok. The place is very pretty but I found the ambiance to be lacking it. It was very quiet then the music got super loud as the night went out. We got chef choice and it frankly was not worth it. the appetizers were okayy and the mains and sides were horrible. They were burnt and presentation was sloppy. Will not be back. Did appreciate the changes made once we gave feedback.', 'The ambiance inside was very nice decorations and large however it is a bit too loud in there\\n\\nthe waiteress was kind and they helped us select our food also watched out for our food allergies.

Th restaurant was dripping with plants in every nook and cranny, which made it feel very cozy. \\n\\nI ordered the avocado toast. It was tasty, but like many places, it wasn't served with a functional knife. For a thick, crusty piece of bread, a serrated knife makes cutting so much easier; a butter knife just doesn't cut it (pun intended)! Our waiter seemed a bit flustered by the ask, but eventually did get me a much better knife. I enjoyed the toast. The pickled onions and pepitas offered nice flavor and it was perfectly salted. It paired well with the hot sauce they provided for the table.

Thankfully, FERNS is one that didn't seem busy cause there were still plenty of reservations available the Friday night before my brunch and so I decided to make a reservation. Even when I came that Saturday, they weren't too busy. My friends and I decided to sit indoors but there were several tables outside that were shaded if you want to sit outdoors.\\n\\nWe got tater tots for the table and all the reviews stating that it was good are not wrong! It was so crispy, like double/triple fried or something! And it came with a delicious aioli that paired nicely. \\n\\nI got the fried chicken biscuit with an egg and it was the right move. There were so many pictures of it and it looked so appetizing but pictures don't do it justice cause it's just as good in person. The biscuit was perfectly made, super flakey and fluffy on the inside but had a nice crisp on the edges. The fried chicken was super fried, just like the tater tots. It was a big piece of fried chicken, and a bit too much batter for me, at least all of it was super crispy. The textures of it all went so well together. You can also never go wrong with a sunny side up egg. I even used some of the aioli from the tater tots with my bites. I think the only thing missing is a kick of spice or something sour like pickles to cut through the richness of the entrée. \\n\\nOverall, it was a great meal and a great place to catch up with some friends. The interior is nicely decorated with lots of flowers and although it's a little dim, it gives off an intimate feel.\", \"I'm so sad to hear the FERNS will be shutting its doors. I only ate here once but I always wanted to go again because of the ambience. It's such a lovely neighborhood spot and their outdoor seating area in particular is a delight. They often have live music and even walking past it would cheer me up.\", 'What a gem this place is!! I usually scoff at leaving my hood and going all the way to LES for brunch, but I\\'m glad I relented this time around. Fern\\'s has an awesome brunch, and I can\\'t wait to go back.\\n\\nThe star is the show at Fern\\'s is definitely the fried chicken and biscuits. I ordered one of their biscuit sandwiches--the one with fried chicken and eggs... and wow! How mouthwatering it was!!!\\n\\nTony ordered a breakfast bowl because he was having a \"healthy day.\" He said it was yummy, and I had food envy looking at it.\\n\\nAnother standout were the tots -- I don\\'t know how they prepared them, but they were super yummy.\\n\\nMost of us also ordered breakfast cocktails, and they were good, too. I recommend the Bloody Mary!\\n\\nAs for service, it was first rate!!! Oh, and the atmosphere is good for outdoor dining!! We didn\\'t sit inside, but I did notice it was spacious!!\\n\\nTry this place out for brunch. You are sure to enjoy!!', 'Great find! Awesome date night spot, drinks were so good will definitely be back. Service was awesome!!! Will definitely recommend to my friends', 'Chicken was succulent. Nice crunch factor to the chicken.

Perfect brunch choice.\\n\\nService was fantastic, the whole ambiance of the place feels like your in your cool grandmothers home. Highly recommend this place for brunch with friends', 'What a lovely nook! Big enough for seating without wait, small enough to feel cozy! Good was good! The side biscuit was perfection!', \"FERNS is a little gem that charmed its way into my curmudgeonly heart. Usually, an unassuming American spot in the East Village, would have me avoiding the crowds that feel over a decade younger than me. But sometimes you just crave a straight forward egg dish for brunch, and FERNS is as good a place as any.\\n\\nI actually first visited FERNS on a tipsy night out, drawn by their beautiful hanging plants. Once inside, I was charmed by their cozy interior--twinkling lights, mismatched framed photos, verdant greenery. It had a picturesque interior without trying too hard. Our group easily squeezed into a space by the front for a few round of drinks and even enjoyed the playlist.\\n\\nSo one weekend when my friends wanted to have straight forward American fare for brunch, I chose FERNS. Their menu featured french toast, biscuits, burgers, and even a mezze platter. I played it a little too safe with an egg bowl, which came with tots and kale and I paired it with a fruit bowl because I was feeling healthy, but looking back I wish I had tried the shrimp burger or something with more flavor. My companion got the chicken biscuit which I stole a bite of and it still haunts me to this day that I didn't order it.\\n\\nBut you know what? The ambience was beautiful, the service was snappy and easy for us walk-ins, and they really just lived up to their claim of being just a good neighborhood bar. They're not reinventing brunch, but all they claim to be is a cozy spot to get drinks and satisfy your biscuit cravings without all the fuss. FERNS, I'm glad you exist.\", 'We came on a busy night and the bouncer was extremely rude. Refused to let us in regardless of our ids we had and flat out ignored us when we asked for a table. Seemed like a nice place on the outside, I wish the service was better.', 'Great food and service as I came here for a birthday party! I enjoyed the ambiance of the party as well as the service from the staff to make sure the party was catered, cleaned up and served with drinks. I was downstairs in the downstairs event / bar room with our own bar staff. It was excellent. The fries were so good! Thank you for a great time!', \"I came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was already fairly packed. Although it was a bit cold, we sat outside since there were heat lamps. \\n\\nI ordered the cheeseburger as well as a side of biscuit. The biscuit were pretty good with the jam and butter. The burger in my opinion was decent but I wouldn't order again. The meat wasn't as flavorful as I'd like a burger to be but someone else may enjoy it.  \\n\\nIn terms of service, the waitress was really nice and accommodating and the atmosphere is good for small groups since the seating area isn't that large. Overall a nice option to do brunch in the city\", \"Came here with the family.  Ordered the Verde white wine from Portugal.  I did not like it.  Switched to the mezcal diablo which was much better. We ordered the Buffalo cauliflower, French fry basket, and steak tartare.  \\n\\nCauliflower was great,  French fries were average, steak tartare was below average. Good flavor but so much going on, you totally lost the beef profile and wouldn't know you were eating tartare. Same with the shrimp burger and chk sandwich.  \\n\\nMuch better without the overpowering cabbage on shrimp burger. It was just too much of it, you couldn't taste the shrimp patty. After taking most of it off, it was so much better. The chk sandwich is good but so much other stuff going on you couldn't taste the chicken.  Also the bun got really soggy and couldn't hold up to the burger. \\n\\nService was good and ambiance was great. Very cozy and romantic for a great date night.  Everyone was nice and accommodating.  I would recommend but would try some other things.\", 'Absolutely amazing brunch experience! Great food, good atmosphere, and friendly staff - what more can you ask for. \\n\\nWhen my friend and I arrived, it is worth noting that our table was not ready yet, even after our reservation time has passed. But staff were so apologetic and polite, and even accommodated us with a donut on the house. And through out the brunch, our waitress was so lovely and friendly. And really made for a great experience overall.\\n\\nOn top of having great staff, the food was astounding. We got the Matcha White Chocolate donut, which was delicious and tasted so fresh. My friend and I also got the Scrambled Egg Bowl and Fried Chicken Biscuits with a side of tater tots to share. Everything was so good - the chicken was perfectly fried and goes well with the flakey biscuits and sauce. And while scrambled eggs at other places tend to be on the blander side, the scrambled eggs at Ferns was flavorful in its own right without overpowering the toppings. And of course the tater tots were freshly fried and just so yummy. \\n\\nAnd to top it all off, the restaurant space had such a cute, eclectic aesthetic and is just lush with greenery. I especially enjoyed the dog themed bathroom (trust me...worth a visit haha). \\n\\nAll in all, Ferns is a new favorite brunch spot for me in NY. Will definitely come back again, and not just for brunch!', \"Made a reservation morning of and they had a few openings outside which was great! The fried chicken was good, not much flavor to it and the biscuit was sweet. Something was missing to make it better but overall it was good. A lot of chicken for such a small biscuit. The stuffed French toast was great though. It wasn't overly sweet and the bread was dense so it was filling as well. I had a spiked coffee and it wasn't anything special. I would advise against it and instead go with the espresso martini which my partner had and enjoyed.\", \"5/5 for the service alone. While everything else tied for top score, why am I screaming about the service? Because right from the moment we entered the place to our exit out of there, we were met with super friendly staff, who went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. Not like the city has ever not been welcoming but New York doesn't really have time for pleasantries of this level. \\n\\nThey have a bar menu that is old school done well and a bar tender who will take good care of you, the drinks are delicious (get the Ardbeg and bacon), I will most definitely come back for the specialty shots . \\n\\nYou will spend a good amount of time choosing between two mains from the menu because everything looks great. We went with the shrimp burger, fried chicken sandwich and the French toast. The shrimp burger was a gamble worth taking on because it was amazing, the fried chicken sandwich was great too. The French toast can be ordered for the table, unless you have a sweet tooth and can handle the whole shebang all by yourself. It comes loaded with whipped mascarpone which is the greatest thing to put on French toast after maple syrup. I simply cannot go back to eating French toast without a big dollop of it. \\n\\nThe decor is cozy and on point for this time of the year. This is exactly the sort of restaurant/bar you want to come to see your friends/tinder date or heck just by yourself. \\n\\nNew York takes pride in its brunch culture, a Sunday ritual that is revered by those hungover from the previous night and those who like to spend hours gabbing and gorging. Ferns is a standout brunch option, I recommend you check out for your Sunday brunch ritual.\", 'Ferns is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. The staff is always friendly, the burger is amazing, and the drinks are great (i recommend the cucumber collins and the espresso martini).

We came at 11am and had a res but probably wouldn't need a res before 1pm.\\n\\n Everything is  dog themed and in the bathroom they have a ton of dog photos and art work. Very cute.\\n\\nWe got the egg biscuit and fried chicken biscuit. Egg biscuit is exactly how it sounds, just eggs on a biscuit and we added avocado. Fried chicken biscuit came with a bunch of sauces which were really great. I preferred the fried chicken because there was more going on.  Both were great but felt the biscuits needed to be warmed / warmer. \\n\\nI'd like to try their donuts here and other foods.\", 'Amazing place for brunch. A friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and it was delicious. This was our first time at this place. First off, our waiter Eric was fabulous! So helpful, sweet, and attentive to everything we needed. He made some great suggestions in terms of our meals. I am not usually a \"spice\" type of girl, but he sold me on the Fried Chicken Biscuit. That thing was so good! Well fried chicken, mildly spicy honey sauce, and the biscuit itself was very soft and tender. My friend had the Smoked Salmon Avocado Toast, which was equally as good. She also ordered a Pickle Martini, which she loved. We shared a plate of the Tater Tots, which too earned all the raved reviews it already has.  And we topped this off with their special Strawberry Shortcake Housemade Doughnut - absolutely delicious!! I\\'m so happy we tried out this place. Also, FYI, there is Jazz on Mondays. Honestly, this place is very cozy and gives a little cabin-type of feel. I highly recommend having brunch here!', \"This place has been on my list to visit for awhile and it was surely worth it.\\n\\nLoves:\\n+ That fried chicken biscuit x3\\n+ The doggie inspired bathroom x33\\n+ Very friendly staff\\n+ Their in-house donuts are pretty good (we had strawberry mango $7)\\n+ The indoor dining area is so cute and cozy\\n\\nHonestly, what more could one ask for out of a Sunday brunch?

This place is pretty spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating, and the decor is so lovely; it feels like having lunch in a nice garden. We started with brunch drinks, the Pineaperol Spritz (great way to mix up your classic Aperol Spritz) and a Bloody Mary, both $15. We had the Mezze platter ($15), which was actually fairly loaded with dip and would be enough for 3-4 people to share. The quiche that day ($14) was salmon and goat cheese, which was loaded with salmon- as a salmon lover, I thought it was great! The fried chicken biscuit ($20, +$2 to add an egg) was a great choice as well. The chicken breading was crispy and the hot honey hit the spot. Service was friendly and attentive.', 'We came here for brunch with the girls. The interior decoration is super cute. We shared the Mezze Platter and Basket of Fries. Both were very yummy! For my main, I got the Avocado Toast with a Fried Egg. This was super unique with labneh and tahini/was very filling, though the bread was a little bit hard on the crust.

With a reservation we were seated promptly. We were seated outside but thankfully it was covered and they had heaters so as it rained we were comfortable. We decided on a basket of fries for the table to share. My daughter also ordered a doughnut. \\nI got the fried chicken biscuit, with a fried egg. The chicken was crunchy outside and moist inside. The biscuit was light and airy with a fillo dough type crunch. The egg yolk added a nice rich creamy sauce. That went well with the sauce on the bottom of the plate. I should have ordered the side salad to cut the richness of the salad. The fries, while good, didn't give the need break of the sandwich. \\nMy wife ordered the avocado toast with a friend egg. She was happy with her meal. \\nMy daughter had the shrimp burger. It was good the cabbage really added texture and another layer of flavor. The doughnut was really good. It was definitely homemade and it was a perfect shareable size.\", \"Amazing brunch spot with warm lighting and hygge vibes! My friend and I snagged a last minute reservation and enjoyed a yummy brunch for two on a Saturday. Their menu has most classic brunch items, including some with seasonable twists. I ordered their Stuffed French Toast which was a behemoth of a french toast comprised of a fluffy hunk of toast soaked in blueberry compote and mascarpone cream. I loved how the creaminess of the mascarpone made the dish feel even more decadent. This was absolute perfection! I'm a little sad they didn't have their Baklava variation but I'll have to come back to try that. \\n\\nFerns is a great spot for brunch in a relaxing, comfy environment.

I've had better\\n- Charred Broccoli and Artichoke Dip was probably my second favorite app. The dip was pretty yummy but I think the bread they chose to pair it with was a little underwhelming\\n- I ordered a single patty dry aged cheeseburger for the main and was disappointed.

I would definitely recommend checking out this spot if you are in the area looking for a cute brunch spot.', 'Staff here is nice! I had the chicken biscuit. The chicken was juicy and the biscuit was a bit dry but the sandwich had a slightly spicy aioli, which helped. We were sat outside. The tables were a bit close to each other so it was hard to get in and out. This also attracted bees but it was okay. The pineaperol spritz was tasty & a nice twist to the of aperol spritz but I prefer their expresso martini!', \"Came by for a late night bite on the weekend. Ferns has a cool vibe and really cute decor. Service was a mix, servers were nice but very forgetful so you weren't seeing them too often. \\n\\nWe ordered the sourdough bread and butter, the deviled eggs, a side of fries, and the bean quesadilla. The quesadilla was the star of the show with a delicious avocado crema. It was so so good. The eggs were pretty tasty. The fries were a bit disappointing but were a good portion.

We also thought the vibe and ambiance was there - as the inside is covered in Ferns and fun little items that make you feel transported out of the hustle and bustle of East Village. \\n\\nFood-wise - we ended up getting the burger (which was a great deal for HH and prob the only time I'd get it going forward), the fried chicken sandwich (it was perfect and the chicken itself was so flavorful and juicy), and a couple of deviled eggs to start. While the chicken sandwich is on the pricier side ($20 I believe), we thought it was worth it as a treat. We also got a side of bacon, which was phenomenal. I imagine their BLT is great too. \\n\\nDrink-wise, we got a HH cocktail and their HH beer+Amaro shot combo. Both did the trick and would order again. \\n\\nWe know it's also a very popular brunch spot, and based off of the chicken in the chicken sandwich, we can see why, and will definitely have to check it out some time! I imagine that sandwich with an egg + bacon on a biscuit would be divine!\", \"Such a cute brunch spot! I loved the decor there! It was kind of a secret garden vibe. Very roomy. Service was attentive. I had the fried chicken biscuit which was delicious. It was so big, I had to eat it with a fork and knife. In the end I couldn't even finish it. The whiskey and bacon was Oban and a slice of bacon, which was very interesting for brunch. Creative! I also had the paprika tater tots and they were delicious. Would come back!\", 'What a cute restaurant full of the coziest of vibes. I felt transported to a place outside the East Village and in fact outside of NYC.

And yes, I went on a Thursday--how fitting! Top that off, we got a table without a wait, though by the time I left there was a long line outside (picture 2). Rain or shine, this place draws a crowd for a reason.\\n \\nNow let's talk cocktails--oh my goodness. Glowing soju cocktails at $15ish, they're a steal for their strength and the vibe they add to your night.\\n \\nWhere do I begin about the food! Truffle mac and cheese, creamy and decadent, with every bite more indulgent than the last. The gnocchi? Pillowy perfection that melts in your mouth. And the dumplings--let me just say, 'delicious' doesn't even begin to cover it. Add crispy fried chicken to the mix, and you've got a spread that feels like a greatest hits album of comfort food, each dish an absolute showstopper.\\n \\nThe best part? The sharing concept. This isn't just a meal; it's a bonding experience. Every dish we ordered became an excuse to laugh, rave, and--let's be honest--fight over the last bite.\\n \\nHere's the deal: Thursday Kitchen doesn't take reservations, and they won't seat you until your entire group is present. So if you've got that one friend who's always 'five minutes away,' plan accordingly. But trust me, the walk-in-only policy is worth it.\", \"We couldn't get in the first time we went, but glad we went back a few weeks later. The vibe inside is super casual but the lighting a décor elevates it dramatically. \\n\\nYou definitely need to order a few dishes so bring friends, but there are plenty of options for vegetarians (try the truffle mac and the edamame dumplings--you're welcome). The ugly potatoes were just fine but that's more of a testament to the other dishes being so good.\\n\\nOverall it didn't take long to get our orders, my only watch out is that there aren't any cocktail options. There's an adult juice pouch situation, but I passed on it--I have an aversion to glow cubes.\", \"Korean Tapas? Cozy Environment? Delicious Drinks? What more could you ask for! \\n\\nThursday Kitchen has been on my radar for a while, and I'm disappointed I didn't visit sooner! I came here on a Saturday with a party of 6.

Rich, creamy, and delicious, with the perfect hint of truffle, without being too overwhelming. There's also broccoli in it, so it's basically a balanced meal! \\n\\nSteak - A crowd favorite amongst the table. While the steak itself was cooked and seasoned to perfection, my favorite part was the feta grits (I could've eaten a whole bowl of them!) \\n\\nThe Kimchi Paella was another highly recommended dish; however, I found myself a bit disappointed by it. While the flavor itself was good, it lacked that scorched bottom that paella is known for. Additionally, the shrimp on top were not properly cleaned, which really put a damper on the whole dish. Besides that, everything else was delicious, and I would definitely return to try more items!\", 'My friend took me to this place because she recommended it and I trust her with my life. She ate here several times with another friend, so she already had the food recommendations down. So many good food choices with one of my favorite people.\\nWe got the lucky noodle, duck confit empanada, truffle mac & cheese, kimchi paella, but most importantly the edamame dumplings. We really loved the Edamame Dumplings, so we ordered two servings of them. We could have just had all edamame dumplings if we were irresponsible about eating in a balanced way as well being true gourmets. The vibe is totally hip and trendy. We waited for a while because of how popular it is. Even the bathroom line was popular. I am still dreaming about the edamame dumplings.', \"Probably my fave restaurant I've been to in 2024! Have always heard about Thursday Kitchen and just assumed I would get to it when I would. Regret not going sooner! \\n\\nNo reservations, walk in only.

Good strawberry flavor, strong! \\n\\nHeirloom Tomato:\\nProbably my least favorite dish but not bad! Wanted something fresh. Leans on the sweeter side \\n\\nLucky Noodle:\\nI'm OBSESSED with this texture. So fresh and chewy! Qq texture. Nice spicy meat sauce with a lime yogurt sauce on top! Loved this\\n\\nTruffle Mac & Cheese:\\nI have a love/hate relationship with truffle. This was good! Not too truffle-y. Sauce was nice and luscious, not clumpy at all. Broccoli was actually cooked well! Still had a nice crunch to it \\n\\nKorean Popcorn Chicken:\\nGood, crunchy, nice sauce. I would put it as average on my scale of KFC\\n\\nSteak:\\nLoved that this comes medium rare only, as it should! I got this DoorDash'd and it arrived perfectly (granted I don't live far from this place lol) they put the soy glaze on the side which I was grateful for so it didn't mix in to the kale (it had a diff sauce on it) or the feta grits which I also loved! \\n\\nI highly recommend going either with a friend/date or group! Good pricing. A bit busy but that's the fun of it! \\n\\nNote: I tried to go on a Monday 30 minutes before their last seating and they had closed early bc it was slow.

I came here for dinner with a large group of 7 people, so we got to try almost all of the items on the menu. \\n\\nEveryone unanimously agreed that the best thing on the menu is the steak. The steak was super juicy and tender, and the decadent grits paired so well with it.

You can't go wrong with their menu.\", \"This East Village spot is the first spot I have tried Korean tapas dining. I arrived there right at opening time (6 PM) proved to be a smart move, as the restaurant is walk-in only and surely fills up quickly (by 7pm the place was packed and there were a few people waiting outside --on a weekday night) The tapas portions are reasonably priced for the portion (in Manhattan). For two people with moderate appetites, four plates make for a satisfying meal to share. Their standout dish was their popcorn chicken which was so irresistible we ordered a second plate. The steak too (served only medium-rare)  comes with a rich, flavorful sauce that perfectly complements the meat's tenderness. But the real surprise to me was their truffle mac and cheese - coming from someone who typically isn't enthusiastic about mac and cheese this dish was packed with rich cheesiness combined with truffle. The dark woody ambience, small table seating, and service all matched the quality of the food. Basically, I will be coming back, definitely 100%.\", \"Came here for dinner and had a pleasant time.\\n\\nCame here on a Friday at 7 and had to wait 30 minutes (they don't do reservations) and it was worth the wait!\\n\\nWe ordered the popcorn chicken, Mac n cheese, steak and gnocchi. I had the cutetini to drink. Everything was super delicious and well cooked. Super flavorful.\\n\\nThe servers were great and the music was great. Seating is a bit tight, but it is what it is. Would come again.\", 'A trendy tapas place with good food and good service. The servers were very attentive and informative; for two people, they recommended ordering 4-5 dishes and they were spot on.\\n\\nSoft shell crab (5/5) - the minute this dish was placed on our table, we began salivating. It smelled so good and couldnt wait to dive in. The plating is really cute with two radish near the claws. The wasabi like sauce really complimented the crab , so much so that i wish there was a little bit more. The dish was a little on the smaller side and because it was delicious, it really made us crave for more.\\nKimchi paella (3.5/5) - not pictured because we were too eager to dive in but came with squid and shrimp. It definitely had a seafood smell, if you know what i mean, and didnt taste too much like kimchi. Overall the dish was okay, but wouldnt say it was a highlight dish. I did like how they gave us a wet towel to clean our hands since we had to peel the shrimp shells.\\nSteak (4/5) - cooked medium rare and comes with cheesy grits and some vegetables. The sauce on the steak was a little sweet but not overpowering, which i really enjoyed, but the steak was chewier than i was expecting so had to dock a full point.\\nTruffle mac and cheese (5/5) - oh man, as someone who lovesss cheese and truffle flavor, my gf cannot stop raving about this dish. It was soo cheesy, gooey, and full of umami goodness. The size is perfect so you can thoroughly enjoy without feeling it was too heavy. You can really smell and taste the truffle oil which really enhances the dish.\\nBread pudding (4.5/5) - a good dish to end the meal! It was very nicely balanced. The compote brought some tartness and the ice cream was creamy.', \"This place does NOT disappoint! We made sure to get there between 5-5:30pm because prior visits proved that past 6pm there is a significant wait time because of how great this spot is. Luckily there are plenty of cute stores and bars nearby to pass the time as you wait, since they don't take reservations. \\n\\nLet me tell you- the food is WORTH waiting. When you enter, it's inviting and dimly lit without going full dungeon mode like some places where you can barely see the faces of the people sitting next to you. \\n\\nFor drinks, we got the golden punch mocktail (the best tasting drink of them all), ruby the gf, lychee reach rich (which came in glow up capri suns which was super fun), and the soju sour. They were all quite refreshing! \\n\\nFor food, they recommended 2-3 plates per person. We got the heirloom tomato, ugly potato, chilaquiles, kimchi paella, soft shell crab, lucky noodle, truffle Mac n cheese, steak, and duck confit empanadas. The flavors went well together but our top tapas were the heirloom tomato, soft shell crab, lucky noodle and Mac n cheese. The steak was cooked more rare than medium rare which we didn't mind, but it would've been nice to have some course salt on top and the kale served was incredible. I could've ordered a whole plate of that kale. The lucky noodle was AMAZING, it had a slight kick and was super flavorful with some nice contrast in texture. \\n\\nService was attentive and our waitress had good recommendations, we had a great meal and overall experience. This place has to go on your list of places to try.\", \"This is my Favorite place in NY. I will have it every time I visit. This is on of my fav places in general.

There's also no reservations so it's first come first serve. If you enjoy truffle then get the Mac and cheese. We got two serving of the crab and the steak. .

The portion size is normal tapas size. The staff is friendly. We went right at opening, so there wasn't a wait.\", \"Thursday Kitchen's Korean fried popcorn chicken, steak, and empanadas were a delightful culinary adventure. The popcorn chicken was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and perfectly seasoned with a tangy, sweet, and savory glaze. The steak was cooked to perfection, juicy, and full of flavor. The empanadas were flaky, filled with a hearty mixture of savory ingredients, and a satisfying treat. While the dishes were delicious, the portions felt a bit smaller than expected, making the overall value slightly less than ideal. That said, Thursday Kitchen's food quality is undoubtedly top-notch, making it a great choice for a satisfying meal.\", \"Seated immediately for two for dinner at peak time on a Tuesday. Service was quick, good with understanding my allergies! Only things that had nuts in them were the asparagus and the paella\\n\\nFood was good, but what pushes this to a 4 was the truffle Mac n cheese.

They wanted us to access the menu with a QR code but AT&T had no service in the restaurant so we had to get the physical menus anyway. \\n\\nThe food was amazing, I mean each dish was just so delicious. The heirloom tomatoes were so fresh and the cheese sauce was the perfect combination. My seafood kimchi paella was so full of flavor, it really soaked in the seafood and kimchi flavors perfectly! The rest of the dishes we got were no disappoint either! I truly could say that all the food tasted so yummy.\\n\\nI'm sure it's because it was a busy Saturday night, but our first hot food did not arrive until after about 35-40 mins since we sat down, which, if you have a group of people and are chatting it up might not be so long of a wait; but for only 2 people on a date night, it seemed like forever. They were very nice in that they gave us some free ice cream samplers at the end bc we were a little impatient with the wait, which we appreciated. \\n\\nI think this is your typical college hang out place and maybe I am a bit old for these kind of spots but it was so so loud in the restaurant, couldn't hear anything without yelling. Not sure if it's a good spot for young professionals who are busy and wants a nice date night dinner. I would love to come again bc the food was so delicious, but given the many roadblocks mentioned, it would be difficult for us to come back...overall though, definitely worth the try!\", \"There's nothing wrong with this restaurant, but none of the food was good nor impressive.

Once seated (only ~15 min wait for 2 at ~6:30p on a Friday) and jackets kindly taken, we launched into our dining experience with little delay. Our dashingly and uniquely handsome waiter was attentive but not overbearing, as we stared into his eyes while giving him our drink and food orders. We then sat and enjoyed the dimly lit basement aesthetic designed to be casual/trendy yet promising of a fine dining experience. Indeed, the sequence of events went as follows: COLD Sapporo draft, AIRY soft-shell crab, CRISPY popcorn chicken, ILLEGAL truffle mac, PUNCHY plantain, and OTHERWORLDLY steak. Each of these dishes nearly brought me to tears on the first bite, leading me to the only logical conclusion that this chef is an absolute genius. Come and eat here.', 'Overall loved eating here.

Wish it came with more gnocchi. It's less spicy than the lucky noodles.\\n\\nI'd come back for the edamame dumplings and try some new plates!\", \"Thursday Kitchen was recommended by a co-worker, and I wish I could kiss them on the mouth for it. Because yes, this spot is just that good and just that unique and just that special. When we arrived, there was a 45-minute wait, but it went be pretty quickly. Once inside, we were ready to go IN. Because this is a Korean tapas spot, they recommend 2-3 tapas per person. So, while the portions are small (and pricey), you're likely to eat things you can't have anywhere else.\\n\\nSo, here's what we got. The soft shell crab (10/10 in terms of breading and the sauce it was on top of); tuna tartare tacos (9/10 cause I wish it would've had just one more); gnochhi (9/10 for being perfectly soupy and spicy and amazing); lucky noodles (10/10 and probably my fave bite of the night); edamame dumplings (8/10 super flavorful, but the texture threw me just a bit); Korean popcorn chicken (7/10 although delish, this didn't blow us away).\\n\\nThis spot is also know for their Capri Sun-style drinks with a soju base. I went with the grapefruit and strawberry versions, and they were refreshing, light but pack quite a punch. \\n\\nOnly cons are how loud it gets in there (it's a small space, so what can you do) and the fact that there's only one bathroom. I had to wait around 20 minutes to use it, so be prepared.\", \"The flavors were certainly present, but the portion sizes were on the smaller side. If you have a larger appetite like I do, you'll likely find that three to four dishes won't be quite enough. I ordered the plantain, kimchi paella, lucky noodle, gnocchi, and steak, along with a bottle of Seoul Night. The plantain was a bit disappointing. While the plantain itself was fine, the accompanying sauce didn't quite work for me. Made from sriracha, goat cheese, and cilantro, the sauce left an odd aftertaste, reminiscent of Dijon mustard, which didn't pair well with the sweetness of the plantain. I think the dish would have been better with a simpler sriracha sauce or perhaps a combination of egg and mayo. Additionally, the portion of plantain was just half, which felt a bit skimpy. The other dishes were flavorful, but again, the portions were on the smaller side. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're interested in tapas-style dishes, but personally, I wouldn't return. The meal didn't quite leave me yearning for a second visit\", 'This was a feast for the eyes and my stomach because everything was so delicious and quite filling. I did appreciate how the server brought in each dish in an order that complimented each other even though these are small dishes standing on their own. \\n\\nThe order it arrived (which is not guaranteed if you order the same items) are as followed Tuna Tartar Tacos, Truffle Mac, Korean Popcorn Chicken, Duck Confit Empanadas, and Kimchi Paella.\\n\\nWhile I was eating the music was very lively and current trending music and people were enjoying their meals and conversations without being too loud since the restaurant has a very chill underground vibe', 'This restaurant was pretty busy on a Wednesday evening and it deserves to be. The food was both delicious and perfect for sharing (my favorite of the dishes ordered was the Korean popcorn chicken). Some of the cocktails come in fun pouches and they were very unique in flavor. Service was on point and the dimly lit ambiance made this place ideal to catch up with friends. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be coming back soon!', \"A cozy spot in East Village, Thursday Kitchen differentiates itself from the many Korean restaurants in NY by serving Korean-style tapas and juice box drinks in a casual environment. It's a fun spot to share good food and try a variety of flavors. \\n\\nAll the tapas we tried were great. My two favorites were the edamame dumplings with a delicious creamy filling and the lucky noodles with good bounce and a kick of spice. The dishes all leaned acidic though, and some could do without the squeeze of yuzu/citrus.\\n\\nThe service and atmosphere were both solid. The space is a bit crammed though and there is a scent of truffle that fills the restaurant. It smelled good but perhaps they need a bit more ventilation.\\n\\nIt's relatively easy to walk into and overall a good pick if you're looking for something more unique than BCD Tofu and more casual than the contemporary Korean spots in the area.\", \"This place is such a fun vibe. I really love how it's set up and love how the dishes are served! This was my second time visiting and everything is always so delicious!\\n\\nI am vegetarian (90% of the time) and they have some decent offerings. You won't really be full by the end, but all the bites I had were really good. The edamame dumplings are really good and have a edamame purée inside.\\n\\nThe ugly potato's are also pretty good and mainly taste like thick fries. \\n\\nI tried the sauce of the steak and wow! That was really good! My friend also said it was super tender.\\n\\nI personally think the truffle mac & cheese was a lot. A little too artery clogging for me and too much truffle flavor for my taste. If you want a super thick and creamy truffley pasta though, you must get this.\\n\\nAlso got the bread pudding and was kind of underwhelmed, so wouldn't order that.\\n\\nOverall great fun restaurant with really cool alcoholic drinks as well! Would come again with a large group so I can try everything!\", \"Thursday Kitchen has a cozy interior, with the tables close together in a smaller dining space. I waited a little over 30 mins on a Thursday evening and was greeted by a friendly waiter and slightly less friendly hostess. The drinks are served in pouches which I don't quite understand the appeal of, but there are a lot of great fruit-forward options. \\n\\nThe food amazed me across the board. The edamame dumplings are amazing, they're almost creamy inside and the truffle oil really comes through. The tuna tartar tacos had a great balance of richness and freshness, and the kimchi paella was excellent. The truffle mac is definitely decadent so would recommend for those who really like cheesy dishes. The asparagus was less remarkable, but still an enjoyable dish. \\n\\nI really appreciate how each dish surprised my palette, every flavor felt like one I haven't experienced before. A lot of the appeal for me was how unique the dishes are, so with the limited menu I would probably wait until there are some new items to come back. Great spot if you didn't make dinner reservations ahead of time and you're willing to wait!\", \"Thursday Kitchen is a fun time with fun drinks and consistently solid food! Everything we ordered was good and I would come back, but I think I expected a little more given the hype around this place. The edamame truffle dumplings were by far the highlight of the meal. The popcorn chicken was good, we got some sort of beef noodle dish that I don't remember, and the soft-shell crab was surprisingly bland. \\n\\nThe drinks served in Capri-sun pouches are super cute and definitely worth a try! The service is speedy and lovely, despite how busy it gets!\", \"Quite delicious, cute tapas menu - we were told that most items are not shareable for 2, but I would say pretty much all were dishes I'd rather share. \\nFood came out inconsistently, so definitely order everything at once. \\nMy favorite dishes were the steak & kimchi paella!\", \"Great place to go with friends and share a bunch of things. The vibes are hip, fun, and dark. Their dishes are small and pricey, but delicious. They're also pretty well-known for their cute drinks in capri-sun style pouches, which taste  strongly of the flavors that they come in.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the truffle mac and cheese, although it is extremely heavy. It's rich, the pasta is al dente, and the cheese sauce has a balanced flavor of truffle. I also liked the duck confit empanadas, which had a good amount of duck inside. In my opinion, you could skip the lucky noodle and get a much better beef noodle elsewhere. For dessert, the popcorn ice cream was good, but it's basically just vanilla ice cream with caramel popcorn.\", \"We visited Thursday Kitchen on a Saturday night around 7:30pm. There was a hour wait for dinner, which I expected worse considering the number of people in line! Once we were seated, the staff attentively checked on us throughout our night. We sat at the outdoor seating below a heater which was lovely given the recent fall temps! We ordered the asparagus, kimchi paella, truffle Mac and cheese, popcorn ice cream, and the strawberry and lychee drinks. \\n\\nASPARAGUS - My favorite dish of the night! It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect level of tangy to complement the vegetable. \\n\\nKIMCHI PAELLA - a definite must try warm dish on a cold day! There was squid and kimchi mixed into the fish and topped with shrimp. The shrimp needed to be peeled before eating but was yummy. \\n\\nTRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE - a complete gamble for me being lactose intolerant but def worth it. The slightest bit salty but truly a comfort dish. \\n\\nThe drinks were so fun with the lights and the Caprisun pouch style! Both the strawberry and lychee were made with soju so something to keep in mind if you are not a huge fan of soju. I wish the mango juice flavor came out a bit more in the lychee as it resembled more of a lychee martini to me but still good if you don't like sweet drinks. \\n\\nPOPCORN ICE CREAM - Large portion!! If you like salted caramel or a good sweet/salty combo, this is for you. Can't go wrong with a good ice cream. \\n\\nWe did have to wait close to 40 minutes for our food after seating but the staff was so sweet and offered us a shot on the house that we did not mind too much. \\n\\nOverall, great place before a nice night out and fun place to visit with friends but plan to wait a bit!\", \"I came at 5:45pm on a Tuesday evening and they already had a line of people waiting to get in!!! So go early!!! \\n\\nEverything was great! Servers were friendly and attentive!! \\n\\nThe decor gives off Korean pub vibes! And their small plates are delicious! \\n\\nTuna Tartare: MUST GET! You get a mouthful of mini tuna cubes, flavors of lime and soy if you dip it in the sauce!! \\n\\nKimchi Paella: like a kimchi rice stew!! It had kimchi stirred with squid and topped with shrimp! Would recommend if you like sour dishes!\\n\\nTruffle Mac and Cheese: super addicting although I though it was salty on my first bite. \\n\\nSteak: it's served medium rare ONLY. Don't order if you like steak otherwise. It wasn't my favorite dish because I don't like kale or grits. But I ended up combining the steak with the truffle Mac and Cheese and it was EPIC!!\\n\\nI also cannot believe I can still get such quality food with this pricing!!! It's amazing!!! \\n\\nI wish I had tried this before I tried their sister restaurant MOKYO. Because Thursday Kitchen is great but MOKYO is better! Go read my review for suggestions!!!\", \"On my weekend trip to NY, my best friend told me I HAD to try this place. She said they didn't take reservations, so we planned to get there kind of early.\\n\\nWe came here for dinner on Sunday, and got there around 5:15. We were promptly seated and there were 2 other parties in the restaurant. By the time we left, it was more packed with almost all tables taken.\\n\\nWait staff was friendly and attentive. We got 2 soju cocktails and shared the edamame dumplings/mandu, gnocchi, and the steak and I would order all of them again! \\n\\nThe edamame dumplings were really good, chewy, flavorful, and a dynamic taste profile. The steak was perfectly tender, well cooked, and melted in my mouth--we finished all the polenta and kale as well. The kale had a great smoky flavor. The gnocchi was in tteokboki (spicy rice cake) like sauce--had a bit of a kick and was very tasty. We slurped the sauce all up \\n\\nNice vibe, good service, and tasty food. Would definitely recommend and come back.\", 'I love Korean food and I love tapas and I love fusion food!! I definitely wish I knew about this restaurant earlier. I split the duck empanadas, edamame dumplings, soft shell crab, and kimchi paella with a friend and felt quite satiated after. The edamame dumplings were my favorite--the truffle oil is a game changer.', \"I was ready to be impressed and love the food here, but unfortunately, I think this is a bit overhyped and the food is just mostly ok. The menu doesn't change, and considering they recommend that each person order 3-4 dishes, is there even a need to come back as you've already tried a majority of the menu dishes? Hah \\n\\nWe ordered 6 tapas, and can only really say we enjoyed 3/6 :(\\n\\nTruffle Mac & Cheese: my favorite of the night! The truffle is pretty strong, it's super cheesy. I know it's a small portion, but for two people, it's definitely enough as it's quite heavy. The most flavorful dish of the night\\n\\nKimchi Paella: a flavorful, more soupy rice. Unfortunately shrimps were overcooked. \\n\\nEdamame Dumplings: this one surprised me the most. Everyone said to order these dumplings, and while I can't say they were amazing, they were a hit in that I was surprised by how good it turned out! It's light, but you can taste the truffle as well. The only downside about this dumpling was that the skin was quite thick, especially at the tops, but it's fine\\n\\nSteak: cooked well, but the serving we got was just soooo salty. Almost couldn't eat this\\n\\nTuna Tartare Tacos: stringy :(\\n\\nDuck Confit Empanada: I love empanadas and was so excited for this one, but the shredded duck was so dried and jerky like, I just really couldn't enjoy or recommend this one.\", \"I was waiting for weeks to try this place thats close to my apartment. I was not disappointed. The dimly lit restaurant was great vibes and they had an awesome playlist going on (mac, weeknd, etc.). The food didn't take long to get to us and the staff was friendly to us the entire time we were there.\\n\\nThe food was AWESOME, the thing i love about tapas is that restaurants can really focus on the food itself. The truffle mac and cheese was no doubt the best mac and cheese ive ever had. the lucky noodles had an amazing texture to them. The popcorn chicken and the crispy crab dish they had also were great.\\n\\nDefinitely will be coming back here again.\", 'Came here for a birthday earlier this year and the restaurant had immaculate vibes. Staff and service were spectacular. Only thing to note is food is on the heavier side. I would recommend the pouch cocktails for sure!', \"I grabbed dinner at Thursday Kitchen with some friends on a weeknight. They set my expectations high and it's safe to say the expectations were met! \\n\\nThe overall vibe of the restaurant was relaxed and warm. The service was fast and friendly and food was coursed appropriately. \\n\\nHighlights of the meal were the extra crispy popcorn chicken, the lucky noodles, truffle Mac, and empanadas. My only regret is not ordering a second bowl of the lucky noodles which had a perfectly balance salt-fat-acid-heat ratio. The edamame dumplings were tasty but texturally a bit mushy. \\n\\nCheck out Thursday Kitchen for a casual date night or group dinner. With so many shareable plates to choose from, everyone can have a bit of what they love!\", \"The best meal I ate in New York. Wait was around 1 hour during dinner time, but they had seats for us outside.\\n\\nWe were seated inside and the service was great! They kept checking in on us, giving us recommendations, and refilling our drinks. Super cute spot with good ambiance-- I recommend a date night here. \\n\\nFood was sooo good. My friends and I were craving good Asian food and got a couple plates to share with one another. Truffle mac was the best I've ever had!! Would definitely come again.\", \"This is my fourth time at Thursday Kitchen and they'll definitely be seeing me again soon. There's a reason why i keep coming back. \\n\\nTheir tapas are classic dishes with their own twist that you can't just find at another restaurant easily. \\n\\nI ALWAYS order the edamame dumplings. The skin is nice and chewy and the filling is creamy, with a light taste of edamame. I also get the steak dish every time i come here because i just love steak and they cook it perfectly (medium rare, you can't choose how it's cooked). \\n\\nI tried the truffle Mac and cheese for the first time and really enjoyed it. It gets a little heavy but that's why you pair it with the yummy kimchi paella. \\n\\nThe vibe is cozy and intimate. Servers are nice and very attentive. Highly recommend for any occasion!!\", \"I love asian fusion places but rarely find places that do both cultures justice - so I had to check out this place since it had so much hype. The line is usually up to an hour long so make sure to come ahead of time to beat the rush. The area nearby is super cute and there's also a ton of cute bars to pass your time.\\n\\nWe ordered the soft shell crab, asparagus, truffle mac and cheese, kimchi paella, korean popcorn chicken, steak, lucky noodle and two capri drinks to share among 4 people. \\n\\nThe popcorn chicken and the mac and cheese are the flagship dishes here. Crispy taiwanese popcorn chicken is probably one of my favorite snacks so I was honestly a little disappointed to find that this variant was super saucy - the flavors were there and were a cool twist on the classic dish but it was just a little heavy (though great if you've transitioned to drunchies already). The other flagship dish, mac and cheese, was super small and I didn't think there was anything too memorable. My favorite here was probably the soft shell crab. It was lightly fried and a little hard to share but the texture was perfectly crunchy. Definitely recommend getting the capri drinks here as well - they add a light at the bottom of the pouch that's super cute!\\n\\nPortion sizes here are a little small but we were actually all pretty full after ordering. I'd say the food was decent but the vibes were really nice especially if you're seated outdoors while the sun is still out. Would definitely come back again.\", 'Yummy Korean tapas. Not much else to say! The ricotta paired well with the heirloom tomato dish and the restaurant has good ambiance.', \"This is a hip Korean fusion tapas spot, yesterday I come with friend and have order Truffle Mac & Cheese, Soft shell crab, Steak, Kimchi paella. More recommended Truffle Mac & Cheese, the kimchi paella and soft shell crab are good. The beef steak was quite good too. Everyone unanimously agreed that the best thing on the menu is the steak. The steak was super juicy and tender. Thursday Kitchen's food quality is undoubtedly top-notch, making it a great choice for a satisfying meal.The servers were great and the music was great.\", \"I came here once several years ago and again recently - still love the truffle Mac n cheese! They don't use just a little truffle oil like a lot of other places - so many heads were turning as they brought that dish out and placed it on our table. The edamame dumplings and gnocchi (their version of tteokbokki) were good. The dessert was amazing - would highly recommend the caramel popcorn ice cream. Their adult Capri sun cocktails are strong as well. It is a tapas style restaurant so everything is meant to be shared.\\n\\nService was quick and attentive and the restaurant fills up quickly around dinnertime on the weekend. They do not accept reservations but if you arrive around 5pm/opening time, it's pretty empty and you'll get seated right away.\"]}, {'id': 'CuwHhq1MKX5hm8YyxtqukQ', 'name': 'Shukette', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2QlGekOdWWrkmAKVfVPbnw/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://shukette.shop', 'display_address': '230 9th Ave', 'display_phone': '(212) 242-1803', 'rating': 4.4, 'reviews': [\"The roasted caraflex cabbage- heaven in a plate! The way it was cooked, roasted and served- total foodgasm!\\nWent there on a Monday evening at 5pm- very busy. Ordered the frena and hummus- the garlic on top of the frena was like butter and the bread was baked to perfection- soft and fluffy! Hummus was definitely not your regular one. \\nMains- roasted cauliflower- nothing great except the roasted cherries, shrimp kebab- excellent and the cabbage - out of the world!! If you're lucky enough to get a reservation, definitely try the cabbage.\", 'Food was great! I highly recommend the joojeh chicken (with the garlic) and the jewelled rice.\\n\\nThe frena bread is a must with some dips including the labneh', \"Shukette is hyped up but worthy. Every dish is an adventure. \\nMy recs: the frena bread and labneh are special, but there's not a loser in the bunch that I've ever seen or tasted. Cauliflower, meat skewers, hummus; each one brings some new delight and flavor, but in a gentle, well-thought-out way. Last time I went, I discovered a delicate, citrusy sliced persimmon and cheese salad, and excellent hot sauce. \\nGreat bar (and bartenders), nice cocktails and a lovely wine selection. Even dessert is fantastic. \\nShukette's vibes are elite. Intimate but not cramped, warm but not riotous, bubbly but not chaotic. Like you've tapped into the mainframe of NYC's energy, but you're freewheeling along for the ride. I've been here twice, and never been rushed or cajoled.  It's become my go-to low-key place to impress sophisticated out-of-towners. Yes, my friend, it IS reasonable to want to live in NYC, and Shukette proves it. \\nI don't care you're tired of TikTok hype or small plates or Manhattan or middle eastern food. Go here and you'll believe in love again.\", \"We came here for the partner's birthday and Shukette offers excellent service and a memorable dining experience. The food is outstanding, with the hummus being a standout--smooth, rich, and incredibly flavorful. We also tried the seasonal Permission Salad, which was fresh, vibrant, and perfect for sharing. For our main, we shared the fish, which was expertly cooked. Bonus that there wasn't bones we had to pick out.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was a lot of fun, with throwback R&B jams. It definitely added to the overall experience and made the meal feel even more enjoyable.\\n\\nThe only drawback was the tight space. Seated at the counter, it was a little cramped, especially with jackets on. We weren't offered a coat check, which would have been a nice touch. While the cozy vibe works for some, I'd likely opt for a table next time to avoid feeling squeezed. Overall, Shukette is definitely worth a visit, and I'll be back for the food and atmosphere.\", \"Easily one of my favorite meals in NYC! I was able to walk in as a party of 3 on a rainy Friday night. Everything we ordered was memorable!! You have to order the labneh and some breads though. It is hands down the best labneh I've had. I still think about it. \\n\\nShukette has perfected vegetables. Each dish was cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with some type of sauce. The broccolini & delicata squash were two stand outs! The steak kebab was so juicy and paired perfectly with the lentils.  \\n\\nOn top of standout food, the service was very fun and helpful! I hope everyone is able to enjoy the food shukette offers.\", \"Went here the other night with a friend. We both LOVE Shuka so wanted to see why shukette was about. First off the restaurant is really cute but on a busy night it's quite crowded. The service was great though. \\n\\nWe started off with the Arctic char dip and the Moroccan bread. Amazing. The one at shuka is slightly better in my opinion as it is whipped but this was still great. And the bread is as well. We then got the philo beef thing...it defiently wasn't what we were expecting, however, it was pretty good. We also got the brussel sprout salad which I loved. Everything was great and the vibe of the restaurant was also great. I would still pick shuka over shukette but wouldn't discourage you if its your preference.\", \"Shukette was one of the best dinner experiences I've ever had in NYC! The food, ambiance, and service were all INCREDIBLE. Not only does Shukette have ample indoor and outdoor seating, but it's beautifully lit with string lights and exclusively plays early 2000s hits. Moreover, the menu itself is perf... I love a small-plate-based menu, and Shukette delivers. \\n\\nMe and my friend ordered: \\n\\nFrena Bread: 5/5\\n- I'm a firm believer that any restaurant worth its while should have great bread and wow... Shukette certainly does. The frena was perfectly fluffy, soft, and warm- my only regret was that we didn't try the rest of the breads!\\n\\nNot Your Average Hummus: 3.5/5\\nIt's not bad hummus by any means, but it's nothing special. If I could go back, I would've ordered a more unique dip that can't be found elsewhere!\\n\\nLabneh: 5/5\\n- The best dip we had all night. \\n\\nShawarma Spiced Fries: 4/5\\n- Great, well-seasoned fries that paired well with the dips!\\n\\nPersimmon Salad: 4.5/5\\n- This was recommended by our waiter and turned out to be one of the best salads I've ever had... so fresh and flavorful! \\n\\nDelicata Squash: 5/5\\n- This and the labneh were the BEST part of the meal. The labneh paired perfectly with the squash and the pomegranate seeds really made the dish sing. Dreaming about this forever. \\n\\nJoojeh Chicken: 4/5\\n- The chicken was great but the saffron yogurt is what REALLY made this stand out. However, this dish took a really long time to come out, so be wary. \\n\\nTahini Soft Serve: 3/5\\n- The soft serve itself was pretty good, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the savory drizzle. \\n\\nOverall, I had the best time at Shukette and cannot WAIT to come back and explore the rest of the menu the next time I'm in the city!\", 'I heard amazing things about Shukette and we were lucky to get a dinner reservation for Friday evening. The place was packed and had an outdoor space as well that was also very busy.\\n\\nWhat can I say but that the food, service, even the music played was amazing! We had so many dishes but the Labneh and arctic char dips with the Frena and Lafa \"rips\" breads for dipping were amazing, along with small dishes like cauliflower, broccolini, sweet potatoes and roasted, char-like flavoring of the shrimp kebab. \\n\\nThe group I was with loved their beer and cocktails and we tried the Mic Drop dessert.\\n\\nAnother highlight was the Sesame Phylo cigar.\\n\\nAgain, service was quick, thoughtful, picking up empty plates and dropping of new items at a wonderful pace.

It's near impossible to pick a favorite or even rank the dishes.\\n\\nThe Labneh is without a doubt a must order for us. My favorite Labneh I've ever had.\\n\\nI am a fan of Muhammara in general but here did it really well in general.\\n\\nLafa & Frena were both wonderful, if I absolutely had to pick one over the other I would choose the Frena, it's buttery, fatty from the oil and garlicky.\\n\\nGrilled Broccolini was cooked fantastic and the lime tahini sauce that went over it was INSANE.\\n\\nGlazed Sweet Potatoes had a subtle not too sweet glaze on them and cooked them perfectly. The herbed yogurt that came underneath it was perfect.\\n\\nDelicata Squash was once again cooked perfectly and the addition of the pomegranate seeds were a perfect balance with them.\\n\\nSteak Shish Kebabs cooked wonderfully and the combination of the sauce and seeds and lentils underneath paired well with it.\\n\\nArayes were INSANE. They were cooked to perfection and the combination of the meat and onions and Seranos, it was so fatty in the best way possible, seasoned wonderful. And dispping it in the white Harrisa made it even better.\\n\\nThe ambiance was so fun and the servers were a good time!\", \"Ode to the Shukette (little market)!  My friend and I happened to pass by this restaurant one Thursday night, and saw it was packed.  In the same street, no other restaurant had lines or was as bustling, so we decided to try it out.  We're so glad we did!  The wait for a table wasn't too bad.  They estimated 30-mins for two people but texted us within 5-mins!  We sat outside, on the side where there were no outdoor heaters.  Still, the staff were very accommodating, even giving us blankets to warm up.\\n\\nWe ordered the Frena (which came highly recommended by the staff), along with the Braised Butter Beans and Arayes.  The Frena is Moroccan bread with garlic and oregano.  It was soft with a bit of crunch on the outside, delicious, and the right complement to the creamy dishes we ordered.  The Arayes was new to the menu, and consisted of a mix of lamb and beef.  The meat was so tender, it melted in the mouth!  The Braised Butter Beans lived up to expectations.  It came with broccolini, a little chili, and some lemon and parsley, and was a hearty complement to the saltiness of the meat.  It also came with a good amount of sauce, which took the place of us ordering any dips.\\n\\nTo top it all off, we ordered mint tea, which was so fresh in taste and smell, it felt homemade.  \\n\\nOverall, the Shukette was a pleasant, unexpected discovery!  I highly recommend!\", \"had a fantastic meal at shukette. The service was incredibly friendly and prompt. The atmosphere was so nice as well - very chic. I will say, i made a res and they sat us at the bar which was slightly uncomfortable- wish we had the option to select table. We stared with the frena and labne which were both amazing. the frena was warm and puffy and soft and cloud like. we also got the shrimp skewers which came with this delicious olive sauce type thing which was yum .\\n\\nthe crudite was totally skippable - literally just a plate of raw veggies... i was kinda expecting sauce or something with it but no. \\u200d \\n\\nChicken was SO YUM. I almost wish it had come earlier because we were both stuffed by the time it arrived. \\n\\nGot the tahini green apple soft serve which is a MUST. So so yummy.  overall a great restaurant . Probs wouldn't go back but def need to hit it once.\", \"Been excited to try this place for quite some time and so glad I finally visited! The vibes live up to the hype and the food is fabulous. Small plates to start and larger plates of delicious proteins to finish up the meal. \\n\\nI loved the labne and frenah, so simple but so delicious. Some of the creamiest dips I've ever had. The fried shrimps were done to perfection, and the squash chips were a fun textural addition to the apps. The chicken was a tad dry, but great flavors nonetheless. The garden cocktail was fresh and not too strong! Fun drink menu. \\n\\nWould recommend trying this place :) Super fun for group dinners.\", \"Lively/sceney spot serving amazing Mediterranean food! Came w some friends for dinner on a Friday and got a whole array of things. My favorite thing here is definitely the Frena w all the dips (hummus, labneh, eggplant). It's also nice that they have a gluten-free option for bread (chickpea cracker) which was perfect for my gluten-free friend. Tried a lot of their mains and sides too- the Joojeh chicken is super tender, and the Zatar fries are also tasty. The drinks we got were all good too, they have some fun wine-based cocktails.\\n\\nService is really friendly and helpful.\", \"I wanted and expected to be obsessed with Shukette and I wasn't. That's not to say that it wasn't very good, but it didn't blow me out of the water like I thought it would. It's definitely an amazing spot for vegetarians, they have many good options. We ordered the arctic char, labneh, frena bread, cauliflower, and butter beans. I would reorder the frena and labneh for sure, and the beans and cauliflower were also really good but for me personally fell short of fantastic. My vegetarian cousin was a huge fan though. We also both really liked the tahini soft serve we got for dessert. Service was fine but towards the end we lost sight of our server for a hot minute and couldn't get his attention when we wanted the check.\", 'Wednesday dinner at 7 pm\\n\\n- hummus, frena, arayes, fish in cage, joojeh chicken\\n\\nService: Our waiter, and section manager were nice people and polite. But the Asian lady host at the front was horrible. \\n\\nAmbiance: loud + packed. Indoor and outdoor tables were available. The outdoor tables used picnic tables, so the utensils were easy to slip on the floor because of the big gap.  Outside table placement seemed way too bizarre, all around the restaurant on the pedestrian side-walk, with no heating lamps.  Never have had this dining experience before. \\n\\nPrice: Ok in NYC\\n\\nFood Quality: Delicious and beyond my expectations.  Loved all the plates.\\nMust have the fish in cage.\\n\\nOne remarkable dining experience in NYC.', \"Everything was so so good, highly recommend!! \\n\\n-fish in a cage: my favorite dish! The fish was so well done and the flavoring is just excellent. I love how there is some sort of veggie or herb thing stuffed inside the fish that just makes it taste like the best fish I've had.\\n-crispy fairytale eggplant: love how perfectly the eggplants were fried and stacked. I personally liked the labneh (yogurt) because I think it balances out the hot honey. \\n-joojeh chicken: really good chicken and the flavorings are really good. \\n-frena: the bread is so delicious, warm, and good. Honestly goes so well with any dip. \\n-not your average hummus: love the presentation. So pretty and cool that there are actual chickpeas \\n-tahini soft serve: honestly did not know what to expect for this dessert. But it works as a dessert, just not something I usually eat. However, I love how cute the dessert looked with the halva floss on top.\", \"I really wish the reservations weren't so hard to secure because this Middle Eastern restaurant is hands down one of my favorites!\\n\\nLet's start with the frena--fresh bread served with whole garlic cloves. It was delicious! Then there's the lafa, a sweet, glazed, thin-crust bread that was absolutely incredible. The spicy cucumbers added a refreshing touch. As for the main dish, the fish in the cage was beautifully seasoned and perfectly charred.\\n\\nA 10/10 experience--I'd come back in a heartbeat and highly recommend it!\", \"Wow loved this spot so much. I'm such a fan of rip & dip type establishments lol, dips are my thing!!! But everything was equally phenomenal. The delicata squash was SO good & flavorful. The butter beans were dreamt about for many nights, they were so savory with a bit of acidity balanced to perfection. The chicken was sooo juicy & nice to dip in the toum. Areyes was amazing, huge so share them but very flavorful and the meat was cooked perfectly so it was still so juicy. The mic drop was so delicious, the tahini soft serve was savory but the pomegranate sauce added some sour notes with the hazelnuts adding a great crunch. Service was great and the staff was friendly while helping with many recommendation questions. Vibes inside were immaculate, loved the open kitchen concept and watching them work. The decor inside was beautiful & bathrooms were so cute. Will 100% be back!\", \"I absolutely love this spot!!! Can't believe I just tried this spot recently. Everything is incredible. We walked in on a weekday, and it took about 15-20 mins. The fish in a cage and labneh are my favorite!! It's so tasty and filling. The bread with the labneh is such an amazing combination. This spot is definitely a place that will continuously to visit! Their cocktails are great as well! Love the ambiance too! Great for a nice dinner out with friends\", \"Great tasting food. Very inventive. The way they combine their spices and the end result is phenomenal.  I get why they're the top of their class. \\nService was great even though they were very busy \\n5 stars! \\nThe Branzino was perfectly grilled along crunchy veggies\", \"Tried the joojeh chicken, lamb kebab, sweet potato, labneh and Mediterranean bread. It was all delicious. The chicken was everyone's favorite, it was moist and the sauces that came with it were creamy, spicy, and garlicky. Tried the tahini and green apple swirl soft serve and it was a nice dessert, not amazing though- I would skip it. Service was attentive and ambiance was nice too. It was super full, we were lucky we got a table on a Saturday right at 5pm. definitely make a reservation.\", 'Everything was delicious that we tried. We had 3 different dips & all were excellent. The pita is warm & fresh. The steak was perfectly cooked. The restaurant smells like fresh herbs & spices. We sat at the bar & it was so fun to watch everything being made. The service was fast & they gave great recommendations. If you love Mediterranean food, you must try Shukette.', \"Shukette is a cozy, intimate spot with a fantastic selection of contemporary well thought out small plates. My personal favorite was the crispy fried eggplant, and their homemade bread is to die for. The kebabs are also a standout, and you must try the tahini soft serve for dessert. The restaurant is super popular, so definitely make a reservation in advance. The drink menu leans more towards wine than cocktails, but there's still plenty to choose from. Highly recommend to come here for a date where you can share all the plates and try each thing off their menu. Service is attentive but if they are busy will try to get to turn the table quickly.\", \"We had an early 5 pm reservation on a Friday. Got seated right away, and even though the restaurant was almost empty to start, it quickly got super lively. We were seated right at the bar, so it was cool to see everything happen in the open kitchen.\\n\\nWe started with the hummus, labneh and two breads. The hummus was good, but I don't think I can taste the difference between good and great hummus. The labneh was the more standout of the two dips for me. Super dense and creamy yogurt. Almost tastes like cheese at first, but then with a yogurty tartness to finish. The figs they add on top add a nice sweetness to balance. The frena was fantastic; it had an amazingly crispy underside, really nice chew throughout, and was well seasoned. The lafa on the other hand tasted really just like a store-bought pita. The tomato jam they spread on top barely tasted like anything, so it was a bit of a let-down.\\n\\nWe then got the cherries, the artic char koftas, and the corn. The cherries were the highlight of the meal for me. So perfectly sweet, a beautiful tender and crispy texture, with a hint of cilantro. Amazing, a must get. The koftas were a let-down. They're served on the rarer side, but it leads to a mushy texture. The fishiness of the char also comes through very strongly. The corn was good but for the most part tasted like plain corn with minimal seasoning.\\n\\nThe chicken was solid as an entree. Really juicy and flavorful, and it comes with the fluffy garlic sauce that adds a strong punch. Wasn't standout though, cause the seasoning on the chicken wasn't super unique.\\n\\nOverall, pretty mixed feelings about my meal, BUT, I think there were some truly amazing dishes I would come back for. Definitely some I would avoid as well, but the menu is large enough that there's plenty more to choose from.\", \"I got a dinner reservation for my birthday and it was the best decision ever -- Shukette has instantly become one of my top favorite restaurants in NYC. \\n\\nIt is a modern Middle Eastern diner giving a casual vibe. Every single dish blew our mind and I could confidently say I recommend everything I got. \\n\\nThe bar and booth seatings are quite cramped and the restaurant is super busy, yet the service is still very attentive. Our server was so humorous and welcoming. He even offered us free soft serve to finish off the night. Hands down the best celebratory meal.\\n\\n＊Not Your Average Hummus *** -- Must order to eat with the frena. \\n\\n＊Smoked Arctic Char -- A mix of salmon, garlic aioli, lemon dill and onion. Delicious to eat by itself.\\n\\n＊Frena *** -- I came for their signature frena and it really hit the spot. \\n\\n＊Khachapuri * -- A grilled mozzarella sesame flatbread. So cheesy and flavorful.\\n\\n＊ Calamari a la Plancha *** -- Loved the citrusy and tangy kick. Cooked to perfection calamari.\\n\\n＊Fluke Crudo * -- One of the bestselling appetizers. A bit spicy but appetizing.\\n\\n＊Grilled Asparagus -- drizzled with yogurt dressing and crushed pistachio.\\n\\n＊Grass-fed Steak Shish Kebab ** -- Medium rare meat filled with smoky flavor. Chef's kiss.\\n\\n＊The Swirl (Tahini Soft Serve and Strawberry Sorbet) -- Both were great but I liked the tahini side a bit more!\", \"My friends and I are now obsessed with Shukette. We reserved about 2 weeks prior for a 4 person table at 8:30.  I walked by around 7 and noticed they had open tables and were accepting some walk ins at the bar.\\n\\nWe ordered everything that the waiter recommended. For 4 of us we ordered the following and felt that it was enough food\\n+ Fish in a cage\\n+ Labneh\\n+ Garlic Bread\\n+ Squash\\n+ Heirloom Tomato Salad\\n+ Scallops\\n+ Ice cream \\n\\nI recommend everything above except the Squash. That was fine but not out of this world like everything else we had. Literally we all couldn't stop raving about this meal for a few days. \\n\\nThe ice cream has a unique taste - initially we didn't love it but after mixing it in with the sauce at the bottom we liked it more.\\n\\nTLDR: run to Shukette immediately\", \"So delicious! One of my favorite meals in NYC. The three of us got the frena and labneh dip and both were amazing! The frena was probably my favorite thing we ordered. The labneh was unique and had a nice strawberry flavor. We got the zucchini fritters and they were good, not great. We got the got the steak shish kabob and it was delicious! The only thing we didn't really like is the crispy eggplant- it was just kind of weird and didn't hit the spot. The tahini soft serve was really good! \\n\\nI would highly recommend coming here but make sure to make reservations two weeks in advance.\", 'Cute place. \\nLittle availability for seating without a reservation.\\nI expected great but it was ok.\\nOur servers were great. Friendly and informed!\\n\\nOrdered multiple dishes but nothing was fantastic. Pea dip was tasty\\nThe hummus was bland and had too much lemon. Not great\\nThe bread was the best thing we ordered', \"Now this is a quality restaurant! I came here with my cousin and I was really impressed by the service here. Immediately upon arriving, the hostess was very kind and welcoming.  I got a reservation for 4pm on a Sunday for outside. It happened to be a bit hot out and the table we were going to be seated at was in direct sunlight so we opted to sit inside. Luckily there was enough room inside to it was no issue! \\n\\nOur waitress got right down to business and told us that the frena was a non-negotiable so we tried it and loved it. You gotta get it with a dip though as it comes by itself. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was because the lamb chops took about 30 min to come out and my cousin was done with dish by the time my food arrived. Other than the food taking a bit longer than I had hoped, everything was excellent. Once I did get the lamb chops they were incredible. Looking forward to coming back sometime soon!\", 'I LOVE YOU SHUKETTE! I had such a great dinner here that has brought me back multiple times. Small plates, fun atmosphere, great drinks, and the staff is so nice and knowledgeable about the menu :)', \"The food at this Mediterranean restaurant was all right but didn't stand out enough to make me want to return. Some items, like the tahini ice cream, looked enticing in photos but fell short in flavor--despite enjoying all types of ice cream, this one just didn't deliver. The cocktails were also a letdown. Due to restrictions from being near a church, they only serve wine-based cocktails, which felt more gimmicky than enjoyable. On a brighter note, the frena bread was delicious, though a bit heavy, and the hummus was solid. These were the only truly memorable items, but there is a good selection of vegetarian options, which is great for getting in some veggies.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the service experience didn't help either. Although we had a reservation, the hostess was unwelcoming and made us wait outside rather than at the bar, even though it was cold out and it was their oversight that our table wasn't ready when we arrived. Overall, this place didn't distinguish itself from other Mediterranean spots, and I likely wouldn't go back.\", \"Amazing food! Lucked out on a Wednesday evening with a table without reservation at 6.30pm. \\nThe place was super crowded and all tables were filled. The food was exceptionally good. Loved the breads, frena was delicious. The dips were great, loved the hummus and labne. The broccolini stir fry and fries was so flavorful. I loved everything we ate and I can't wait to go back and try more.\", \"Shukette was a place I was sooo excited to finally get a reservation at. Don't get me wrong it was really good. The service was great and everyone was so welcoming. All the food was good, but I have some critiques. The hummus was already, labneh was great so I would skip the hummus. The breads were sooo good, but paying 8-12 dollars for one pita is insane in my opinion. Every great Mediterranean place I have been to in the city usually brings unlimited pita or at least includes pita with the order of a dip. The restaurant was really cute and I did have a great time! I think I would go back, but wish the pita situation was different for sure.\", \"Amazing food and amazing vibes!\\n\\nI love the shareable style of dining that this place has, and every dish was exceptional. We made an outdoor patio reservation right when the Resy came out, and I would recommend doing the same just since reservations seem to fill up quickly. The outdoor space was perfect for a summer evening, and the rest of the space was cute and packed.\\n\\nShukette's flavors were so on point with authentic Middle Eastern food. The spring rice was honestly my favorite with its fresh taste. The frena bread was so fluffy and was great to dip in any of the dishes. My only note was that the smoked arctic char is definitely a stronger flavor, and it did not complement the other dishes we picked out. However, it still tasted great, and my friend mentioned that as someone who normally does not enjoy fishy/smoked flavors, she thought it was delicious. \\n\\nI was seeing the tahini soft serve recommended everywhere, and it was surprisingly delightful! I have never had a dessert remotely similar to its flavors. I am not entirely sure I would order it again if I were to come back, but I recommend everybody try it at least once. \\n\\nOverall, I would argue that this place is worth the hype!\", \"My partner and I visited with my good friend, Michael, and his partner, Modupe, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional. Despite the rainy weather, our server was attentive and quick to notice when the rain started to pick up, ensuring we were comfortably moved to a covered area before we got too wet.\\n\\nAs for the food--simply unforgettable! Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, easily making it our favorite meal in New York during our stay. Every bite was a delight, and we found ourselves savoring each course. The culinary experience was nothing short of amazing, and we're already looking forward to our next visit!\", 'Incredible flavors. The dips are a must-try! I loved the labneh and the merguez kofta. The fish also looked delicious and will have to try that next time.\\n\\nThe staff here is friendly, and the atmosphere is very lively with the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen. As for seating: I walked in with a party of 2 at 5pm opening and we were shocked to see how packed the restaurant already was! We were offered the last two open seats at the bar or at a table with a 1 hour time limit. Definitely recommend making reservations in advance.', \"Really popular spot in new york so had a lot of expectations for this. My friend and I got a last minute 9pm reservation for sunday night but we were seated earlier. Staff was prompt and friendly. I thought this was a traditional middle eastern spot so was quite thrown off my the explicitly pop music playing. Overall ambiance was giving cute diner. \\n\\nFood quality was good but nothing mind blowing. We got labneh dip and frena bread, adana and jooheh chicken. Tahini ice cream was my favorite dish. Very very heavy food overall, especially the chicken. \\n\\nNot disappointed but unsure if I'll go back\", \"This place had good reviews, and my daughter and I both wanted to check it out. It's a smaller, tight  space. The cooking area is along the length of one side of the restaurant with booths across the length of the other side, separated by a narrow walking path. \\n\\nWe were seated all the way in the back at a half booth table. Considering how busy the small place seemed to be, they were pretty organized and efficient. We got our food at a decent time. We ordered the Smoked Artic Char dip with the Frena bread. For our mains, we shared the Roasted Delicata Squash, Roasted Cauliflower, Kofta, and the Grass-fed Steak Shish Kebab. All of the dishes were so flavorful! The flavors were pronounced, but not sharp. And the flavors within a dish all complimented and balanced each other very well. We were all very impressed. \\n\\nWe'd come back if we were looking for something not on the heavier side.\", \"Absolutely loved Shuka so had to give its sister restaurant Shukette a try. \\nIt was pretty difficult to get a reservation here. Would try to get in Resy right when reservations come out as they tend to fill up rather quickly and on weekends they do not take walk ins. \\n\\nThe restaurant inside is relatively small but I really like the aesthetic. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I like how open the kitchen and preparation of food is. You're able to see the quality control for food/prep before it's taken to the table. \\n\\nThe menu and tasting of food is very similar to Shuka although the menu is more for small bites or tastings and promotes more of a casual dining. \\n\\nThe frena, hummus, and kofta were absolutely delicious. The fries were well seasoned but I think overly salted. The pita was good and very airy which I like, but I wish they gave more than one piece per order as it was relatively pricey for just one piece.\", \"Third time dining at Shukette, and the combination of excellence: vibes, flavors, service will keep this as a must visit whenever I am in the city.\\n\\nEvery bite for me speaks of well curated ingredients and recipes.  The space is so cozy and still perfectly buzzy.  Lighting and music are set a perfect levels.  Every patron is always having a great time.\\n\\nI'm a designer of restaurants myself, and  Shukette, for me, has achieved a level of creativity and 'rizz' that should be the goal for any dining establishment.\\n\\nI suggest counter seating for the best view of the action.\\n\\nLove this place!\", \"Shukette is a very tough reservation to get. For good reason. It is delicious Mediterranean. Hands down. Made from scratch. Inventive. Fresh.  Friendly service. Open air kitchen. \\nNot to be missed:\\nLabneh\\nFrena \\nLafa\\nNot your average hummus \\nMeatballs \\n*Here is a con for me, however. It's small. There is not much space to wait for your table which is a vibe killer when you have high expectations.\", 'This place looks great, & we went there to celebrate a birthday with family. But found it super  busy despite reservations. Wondering if they are booking more than their space or capacity. We got text to come early on a Saturday, 2 weeks back and there was a disconnect between those who send texts & the front desk, they were unaware & confused. Finally they seated after waiting outside in minus 1 degree temp for almost 2 hours. There is no waiting area & my daughter got sick soon after due to being outside for so long. \\nAnyhow, Food & service was good. We started with mint tea, that was barely brewed. We ordered Shwarma spiced fries; they were hot and crispy, frena bread was too good, hummus was appetizing, lamb entree were fine, & caged fish was just ok. Hostess was warm and after all the wait & chill, we enjoyed our food. Next time we may try but in summer.', \"This was our first dinner in New York and it set quite the standard. We had a reservation for 6pm on a Thursday night and it was already so packed. We were seated at the bar and could see the bartenders preparing the drinks. We weren't really in a drinking mood so we shared a drink, I don't remember the name but it was fruity and citrusy. \\n\\nTo start we got the Hummus with Frena! We had a hard time deciding on which bread to try but the Frena was delicious, the perfect vehicle for the hummus! We got the Fatoush Salad and Crispy Sunchokes next, the salad was good, simple but nothing mind blowing. My first time trying sunchokes and they were pretty good! It's kind of similar to a potato but a little sweet, it was unique, but the sauce it came prepared with was even better. Our main star of the show was the Fish in a Cage. The fish was cooked perfectly, it was so tender and the sauce it was covered in was delicious. It came with 2 sauces as well but I didn't think it needed it. The portion was also huge, my partner and I attempted to finish it but we had a hard time, definitely bring more people if you want to kill this! \\n\\nWe were too full for this dessert but the soft serve looks delicious. I'd like to try it next time!\", \"Is this what it's come to, or a repudiation of a frenetic New York dining experience.  \\nAs soon as you enter this dining space, from the start to finish, your experience is punctuated by loud, percussive rap music. I like rap music and sometimes listen to it. But its use of it in this setting as a magic potion or failsafe imprimatur to propel mostly middle-aged well off couples or groups into an aura of the latest cool, semi frenzied dining experience, left me wondering, is this what it's come to, as we chase the illusion of hyper connectedness and jettison the experience of quietude, the self and dialogue with the other. While the food is good even excellent , like many restaurants, it's mostly the same food that's been served here for the past several years, although there are usually a few inventive new appetizers. Of course there is a lot of effort and talent behind this dining enterprise. But to me, the very paradigm underlying this experience is cracked, like a bowl that cannot contain any content. Something is lost with scrolling culture.\", \"LISTEN!!! I will cross oceans to eat here again. Omg, the best Mediterranean food I've had ever! Hands down! I was so happy to be able to book a reservation here and experience the insanely delicious cuisine. The setting is perfect. Location great. Service impeccable! Mouth watering food! And memorable! A MUST HAVE.\", \"Everything was fresh and tasted good, though not mind blowing.   My biggest gripe is that Shukette was overpriced with small portions (6 medium shrimp for 18, a small bread for 10, pies is ordered separately from dips).  We were not full and spent 30/person on each.  \\n\\nService and ambience was fine- we sat outdoors in the non covered section and there happened to be lots of fire trucks blaring their alarms, but not the restaurant's fault, obviously.\\n\\nWe decided to give Shukette a try after loving Shuka downtown.  I would just stick with Shuka - I prefer the ambience there, and the food is more delicious and filling for less.\", 'everything was out of this world with flavor. The food came out as it was ready. We had the the hummus and feta dips with the pita and the flaxseed crackers (GF!). The citrus salad was so refreshing. We also had lamb chomps and fries and our favorite dish, the meatballs. \\n\\nWe walked in on a Sunday afternoon and had no issue being seated. The only negative part of our experience was the chair outside which were uncomfortable.', 'So glad we were able to get a reservation here! The flavors and quality of all the ingredients truly impressed me, every dish was very tasty. Service and atmosphere were great. Will definitely be back!', 'Shukette was great - fresh ingredients done well. The garlic dip definitely enhanced the flavors of meatballs and steak, so I do recommend ordering that. The garlic bread was definitely a must. The server recommended that we use that for hummus, and that was a good call.

A dedicated manager was on hand to control the crowd, ensuring the space never felt too crowded, which definitely deserves some brownie points.\\n\\nThe tacos were the highlight of my visit. The chicken and pork tacos were particularly outstanding, with the pork tacos standing out for their incredible flavor. The seasoning and tenderness of the pork made it my favorite.

Los Tacos No.1 looked to be one of these interesting looking options, so I decided to pop by on a Wednesday around 6:30PM.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is located near Times Square, and I expected it to be very busy based on the location. There was a 15 minute wait starting just outside the restaurant to getting in and then ordering at the front, and lastly getting your food. There are not places to sit, but rather standing tables scattered throughout the restaurant. You may have trouble finding a place to eat for a couple of minutes till people start slowly clearing out - there are also workers that will help direct you to a place where you can enjoy your food. \\n\\nI got two quesadillas, the carnde asada and the adobada. Both were delicious - the tacos came out piping hot and they needed some cool down before enjoying. The meat was seasoned well and had a pleasing and hearty texture, which is complemented by the garnishes on top. Plus the addition of the cheese made these taco-quesadillas very indulgent - I could see these hitting really well after a night out in the city. I am a fan of the garnish bar, where they have various salsa and radish toppings for you to add to your liking. Some of the toppings are spicy, so be prepared.\\n\\nTo Note: As tasty as the tacos were, I agree with a bunch of the other reviews for this establishment - the tacos are overpriced for how much food you can get. I think you get tacos that are just as good, if not better at a local restaurant/taco truck/pop up stand for half or even a third of the price (Since $5 - $7 for a singular taco is up there). I think that these tacos are located near Times Square, which likely drive these prices up, but nope, after seeing Los Tacos in various shop locations in Manhattan - you can expect the prices to be identical!

Most of the line has to wait outside. Menu is simple. You can sample the drinks. You'll order and pay, take your ticket to the other end and tell them your tortilla and toppings. Moves fairly quickly. \\n\\nWe got carne asada tacos and chicken tacos on corn tortillas. The flavor is definitely there and the portions are decent. The tortillas are made fresh in house and are delicious.\\n\\nThe standing tables move fairly quickly and overall the place is clean. \\n\\nI wouldn't compare these to California tacos because 1. This is New York 2. This isn't a taco truck/ stand 3.Rent is probably significantly higher \\n\\nStaff is also friendly\", \"Honestly so good! I'd you're from California and have had the taco stand it's very very similar! So while it's great it's definitely overpriced Mexican food but it is fresh and delicious. It is usually super busy so service can be chaotic but they do their best. Lines can get very long so just embrace yourself. Tacos were so good and the chips are fresh too. It's usually full in there keep that in mind and lines can be long too.\", 'Busy spot, but the line moved fast and customer service was excellent!\\n\\nTheir tacos reminds me of Tacos 1986 in LA.\\n\\nThe line to order was long but it moved pretty quickly. Once you place your order you move over to the right side of the restaurant and give your receipt to the pick up line and you can head over to the salsa bar.\\n\\n- Carne Asada Taco (5/5): Carne asada is my favorite! Flavorful and tender meat, so delicious\\n- Al Pastor Taco (4/5): The meat was a teeny bit dry in my taco but still delicious flavors', \"This place is super well rated and it was just okay for me.  \\n\\nService is fast and chaotic, with people taking your ticket and fulfilling it at different times. \\n\\nThe carne asada was better than the chicken but SUPER wet for such a small taco. \\n\\nThe toppings were better than the meat for sure, and the especial was tasty but not worth $9 for a glob of cheese fried in a small tortilla. \\n\\nIf this is the best taco in NYC, I'm done eating tacos here.\", 'This place is a must when in NYC. Great to see more and more locations pop up across the city. \\nOnly minor point is that the meat (adobada) was a little salty today. But the service is great and the place is always packed.', \"I didn't realize there were so many Los Tacos No. 1 locations in the city, but I'm glad I found one! There was a long line when I arrived, but it moved quickly. \\n\\nSERVICE - The service was efficient; just be ready to know what you want by the time you get to the front.\\n\\nFOOD - I ordered the carne asada taco, chicken taco, and carne asada quesadilla. While the tacos were packed with flavor, I'd recommend skipping the quesadilla--it's pretty much the same as a taco but with melted cheese, which I felt detracted from the meat. The tacos themselves were so delicious that they didn't even need salsa. \\n\\nOverall, a great spot for tasty tacos!\", \"Great tacos but coming from Texas it is pricey which is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's crowded but the line moves fast. My favorite was the adobada - it had a wonderful char so it was crispy yet still tender. The toppings were excellent, especially with the thin slice of pineapple. The carne asada was good but nothing too spectacular. I think it's worth it to try, but if you're coming from somewhere else with good taco spots then you may want to lower your expectations a little. \\n\\nFood: \\nAdobada tacos: 9.5/10\\nCarne asada: 7/10\", \"After living in California and visiting Mexico so often, I was skeptical about this place.. the reviews don't lie. Get here early because it can get super busy and they can sold out of items from their menu. Definitely recommend the carne asada taco!  Goodluck looking for a space to eat\", \"Sorry I was so hungry I forgot to take pictures.  lol.  Finally made it here after reading all the fabulous reviews.  In my honest opinion,  the food is expensive for the size of the portions.  We tried the Chicken, pork and beef soft shell corn tacos.  All were delicious and of good quality I just thought they would be larger for the price point.   \\nThe other con...no place to sit and eat when it freezing out.   You are shoulder to shoulder and standing at counter.  But hey it's Nee York City.  lol\", \"Came around 10pm on a Monday night and the restaurant was filled with people. No wait to order and then waited 5-10 mins for the tacos. You have the option to choose corn or flour tortillas. They ask if you want all the toppings, which I recommend you do. \\n\\nI got the pork and chicken tacos. So good! The tacos were juicy and had great flavor to them. The salsa was good and had a nice kick to it. I definitely recommend trying this spot out if you're looking for some tacos. The horchata was okay as well. \\n\\nWould come back if I visit New York again!\", \"When in NYC, this is a go-to spot for good tacos, no doubt. Personally as someone from LA, I can't get over how overpriced these tacos are at almost $5 per taco. It's a good splurge when you have a taco craving, but I don't come too often.\\n\\nThe adobada on corn tortilla is definitely the must get here though. Don't forget the hot sauces and condiments on the side to add some extra spice on your tacos.\", \"The lines can get excruciatingly long and it's always crowded inside but Los Tacos is well worth those negatives.  Once you order from the right side, get your ticket and give it to the staff on the left side of the restaurant (don't lose your ticket).  Food doesn't take too long to get out, and staff is fairly patient even despite how busy it can get.  There isn't anywhere to sit, so the real estate on the standing tables are at a premium.  Forks, limes, and aluminum foil (for taking home leftovers) are at the counter, while napkin dispensers are located at the sides of the restaurant and on tables.\\n\\nI personally recommend the Adobado Quesadilla (marinated pork) and Pollo Asado Taco (Grilled chicken).  The meat is well seasoned, savory, and tender, albeit slightly salty.  While I love horchata, I thought it was too diluted for my taste.  Prices are about $5 per taco and $6 per quesadilla.  I'd definitely return, though maybe at a different location.\", \"This place was delish!! Being privileged with mexican food from Texas I was a little skeptical of this place at first. ( typically up north mexican food does not hit) However, this place was fabulous!! \\n\\nI loved the salsa bar and the standing room to eat.\\nThe service was good and don't be discouraged by the line it moves very quickly! Do not expect to sit down and eat and definitely be okay with taking the food to go!\", 'Due to the hype and the price, I wanted to hate it but it was very good. It was worth the $5 plus I paid. It had a mix of different flavors, was aesthetically pleasing and was complex in the flavor. You did not need to put any other sauce or lime because it was already packed with flavor. Last time I got a different meat and it was really good as well.', 'Absolutely delicious, the line may look long, but it moves pretty quick. Our group ordered 15 carne asada tacos with Coca Cola and the food did not disappoint at all. Hot, fresh, delicious, I would definitely come back here again!!!!', \"This taco joint truly holds its own against the best that LA has to offer. The service is remarkably quick, allowing you to enjoy a satisfying meal without a long wait--often in under 10 minutes. What really shines here is the sauce bar; the sauces not only look appealing but pack a genuine spicy punch, adding a delightful kick to your meal. It's heartwarming to see a place that prioritizes both quality and efficiency, ensuring you leave happy and satisfied.\", \"Some of the best tacos I've had in a long while! The vibe is very casual-- it's not a sit-down type restaurant. The service was fast, especially considering the long line!\\n\\nI got one of each taco (pork, beef, chicken) on corn tortilla. My favourite, by far, was the pork-- so so sooooooo good! It was seasoned very well and the meat was very tender. The chicken, on the other hand, was a bit bland so I had to add more sauce.\", \"I had no idea Los Tacos No.1 had another location besides the Chelsea Market!\\n\\nWhile being stuck in the loop of Times Square and starving for a non super touristy spot, we stopped by this awesome location with a line out the door while you window watch people eat their food and carefully try not to drool as your stomach yells at you for eating itself as you're going through the line.\\n\\nFresh, quick, delicious tacos. The team here at Los Tacos No.1 is fast at work and artfully making tacos. They take their job very seriously and their priority is making you delicious tacos. From quesadillas (the Mexican way) to tacos, you can get nopales on pretty much anything on the menu. My ooooooonly request would be if they had mushroom since the nopal does get a little slubbery.\\n\\nPro tip: order con todo and stop by their salsa station for a spicy kick. \\n\\nAwesome and huge location compared to the Chelsea Market. It's a spot to grab a quick bite and keep moving. Which sometimes, that's all you want to do. Don't forget to order horchata or tamarind juice to complete your meal!\", \"One of my absolute favorite taco spots actually, it's the only taco place I genuinely crave and 'feen' to go to! The tacos here are always packed with intense, delicious flavor that leaves me coming back time and time again.\\n\\nMy go-to is the adobada pork taco. The meat is marinated perfectly, and I love that they offer a variety of fresh toppings, so you can customize it exactly how you want. The quality of the pork is consistently top-notch, juicy, and tender, and although the tacos may seem small at first, they're indeed packed with just the right amount of tastiness in each tortilla. Every bite satisfies my craving.\\n\\nAnother huge plus is how fast the service is, even with the long line outside. Don't let it scare you off; the line moves swiftly, and once you're inside, you see the efficiency of the whole setup. The team here has a system down to a science, making sure each taco is served hot and fresh, with all the care that goes into making a fantastic meal. It's truly impressive to see how they maintain such high quality and speed, especially given the constant rush in the heart of Times Square, where quick service is essential.\\n\\nMiguel L helped us during our visit, greeting us warmly with a big smile, and he was super helpful in making sure our order was perfect. The entire staff is welcoming, and you can feel the love and effort they put into every taco.\\n if you're in NYC, it's a must-visit take out/to go spot\", \"My favorite taco joint in NYC!!!  FINALLY, after all these years NYC has a decent taco establishment. I've been a fan since they opened at Chelsea market and I was so excited to see them flourish and open a second location near Times Square. This is as real as you can get without flying to Mexico ... or LA, hahahaha. I love that they make their tortillas fresh, right in front of you, onsite. You can't go wrong with flour or corn. I usually get one of each and always go with the beef tacos. I love watching the whole operation, its definitely an experience. \\n\\nBe ready to order at the cash register and then give your ticket to one of the guys who will personally make your tacos for you. Then grab a spot at the counter and eat fast. No seats, just eat. The salsa bar is also legit with the best red and green sauce, super chunky and spiceeeeeeeey. Don't forget to do a palette cleanse with a radish. \\n\\nAlso, if you are trying to practice your Spanish, this would be your moment to do so. Prices are higher than LA, about $5 per taco, but the size is slightly larger and I love the way the wrap them for you. You'll see.\", \"I will admit that at first, I didn't get the hype about Los Tacos No.1. I first tried it at Chelsea Market and was lowkey unimpressed with the carne asada taco on a corn tortilla because I thought it was too dry. Now, years later, I decided to make my return and have finally nailed down my perfect order: adobada quesadilla on a flour tortilla con todo. It's juicy, soft, tender, and flavorful...it's literally perfect and only one is needed to fill me up. Be warned though, your hands will be a greasy and oily mess after but it's totally worth it. My next goal is to get a breakfast burrito here one day!\", \"Every time I come to New York I always come to this place and it tastes the same every time. It's one of the best tacos that I had in New York. Service is always fast and the cooks behind the counter are nice and quick. It is also very hard to find a spot to stand.\", \"It's definitely busy here. We had to go to flushing to make a concert later and i was tweaking in line a bit not sure we'd make it. I think it was about 40 min total in line? But once youre up front in the assembly line it's pretty fasf. Theyre kinda pricey tacos but not in a gentrified way lol. Very authentic and just plain good. There's also a salsa bar on the side too. We stood at a counter, munched away, and made our way out. Two tacos was enough to fill me up\", \"Great tacos. It reminded me a LOT of my experience in San Diego at Tacos El Gordo, but I actually preferred Los Tacos No. 1 by a liiiittle bit.\\n\\nThere's a line outside - this location is right next to Madison Square Garden building - but it moves fast!\\n\\nYou give your order to the person at the front, where you also pay, and then get a ticket.\\n\\nYou wait on another line to hand the ticket to the guy taking orders once he's ready, and they start assemblying.\\n\\nI ordered adobada and chicken tacos. 2 tacos doesn't sound like much, but it was the perfect amount to satisfy me.\\n\\nI like how many condiments they offer - pico de gallo, raw radishes, two different salsas, and limes.\\n\\nThe tacos here are really good, and the meat is packed with flavor. Definitely recommend!\", \"The line was long and moved quickly. It was a relatively small menu and we ended up sharing some tacos, chips and guacamole. But, everything was simple and done well! Managed to tuck into a standing spot at the counter and enjoy everything! I think the pork was my favorite, but you really can't miss!\", 'The portions are very generous and the menu is very straight forward. After ordering with the cashier, make sure to give your ticket to the counter - they\\'ll ask if you want corn or flour tortillas and if you\\'d like your tacos \"con todo\" (onions, cilantro, guacamole, salsa).\\n\\nI really enjoyed the chicken tacos - super juicy and the guacamole really sealed the deal! The pork tacos were also very flavorful but a bit salty for my taste - however the sliced pineapples helped offset the saltiness a bit. \\n\\nThey also have limes, radishes, pico de gallo, and two hot salsas (smoky chipotle and a dark green spicy salsa) available to the side for toppings.', \"This location is my favorite of them all.\\n\\nNumber 1 tacos? You better be able to back that up with a name like that. Well I can say that these tacos are really good. Fresh ingredients, hand made tortillas and a salsa bar. They don't have a huge selection of tacos but the ones they have are great. This place gets very busy but the line moves fast. There is no seating inside. They do have stand up benches.\\n\\nOverall this is the best taco place in New York.\", 'Long line at dinner time.  We waited sometime outside of the store.  The line moved quick too.\\n\\nThis is only standing room.  No chairs to sit down.\\n\\nCame from San Diego and exposed to authentic Mexican food.  The tacos at Los Tacos No. 1 tasted authentic.  We ordered 3 tacos, nopal, asada, and pollo.  All yummy, but they are pricey $18 for 3 tacos!  I guess this is the price for tourists.', 'We were visiting NY and this was our first stop after landing. My boyfriend asked \"really? this is what we\\'re gonna eat?\". I knew it was gonna be good and I heard if we ever visit NY, we gotta try this place. It did not disappoint. There was a long line and it did take a bit to get our food but it was worth it. They only have tables, so you\\'re like standing while eating which I do not mind. It was clean in there and employees were out cleaning around.', \"Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb. Must try when in manhattan!! It's a bit of a wait but totally worth. The pastor tacos was everything. They give you so much meat! Every table is stand up but people move pretty quickly, so you'll get a spot. They have a mini sauce bar which was really clean and easily accessible. We went back twice! It's a vibe here. Def try!\", 'Delicious, fresh, made to order food!! Workers are quick and ready to guide you on where you need to go. Very small and tight inside but worth the wait and workers are constantly cleaning the stand-up tables and sweeping floors.', 'Granted, these tacos may be the best in NYC, but being spiked for choice living closer to the Mexican border, these were ok. \\n\\nWe did love their nod to authenticity, not only in the food but the overall taqueria experience. Don\\'t fancify my tacos, just give me the good stuff on a plate, and they did.  \\n\\nThe asada tacos were probably our favorite of the three we tried. \\n\\nThe adobada was effectively a \"Al pastor\" taco. Good, but not much of a flavor punch there. \\n\\nWe are normally a nopales fan, usually one of our fave types of tacos, but here, not as much. Super bland, but did enjoy the grill notes coming through. \\n\\nLoved they were on corn tortillas.  Could have used a double stack like how street tacos are usually served. \\n\\nHonestly better than I expected this far north. But if you\\'re from Texas, Arizona, Cali, you\\'d be better off getting another few slices of pie in NYC instead...just sayin.', \"Probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. The line is long but moves fast. Standing room only to eat, but that didn't ruin anything. We went twice in one day, it was that good. Definitely stop here if you get the chance\", 'Easily the best tacos in NYC. I was shocked by how much flavor was packed in these little guys. I wish I could eat these tacos every day.', \"Best tacos near penn station. The salsa bar was awesome. Lines can be lengthy however once your then comes, food gets served fast. The ambiance is good.

The waitstaff were super friendly too!\\n\\nThe only downside is the restaurant is near the Manhattan bridge so outside seating is kind of loud.', \"Okay so the deal with this place. We got in line 45 minutes before it opened on a Saturday in October and were one of the first parties in the first seating. The line 10 min after us was around the corner and then down the street. When we left about 45min from when we sat down they stopped taking people on the wait list because it was full.\\n\\nOkay now that that's out of the way... how was the food? Very good, but not good enough to wait in the line again.\\n\\nMy friend and I split the honey butter pancakes and the egg and cheese sando. We added sausage to the sando. Everything was good. The pancakes are a big order and a bit too sweet to each alone but you'd be crazy not to order them. The sando was really good and a good savory item to balance out the sweet.\\n\\nAll in all I have no complaints. I just will not be coming back here until the line dies down or they open another location. They have the demand to open up a much larger location and I hope they do so.\", \"We arrived an hour before opening on a snowy Christmas Eve to find ourselves first in line. Not long after arriving, the line steadily grew until they opened the doors at 10 AM. We saw a few groups with reservations arrive shortly before opening so keep this in mind if you can plan.\\n\\nWe sat at a corner table in the back and enjoyed the simple decor and traditional diner feel. Service was efficient and friendly, and our food arrived quickly with our waiter checking in with us a couple of times throughout the meal.  We particularly enjoyed the egg sandwich with the hash brown patty and scrambled eggs, which were creamy and flavorful. The pancakes were incredibly fluffy and had the perfect level of sweetness and a hint of lemon flavor. \\n\\nPros: A cozy diner experience with a unique pancake offering and delicious breakfast options. \\n\\nCons: It can be a 1 to 2-hour wait if you don't come before opening time and making a reservation is recommended.\\n\\n*Side note: Golden Diner is located across the street from Banh by Lauren which usually has a long line in the mornings during the week, and arriving an hour before opening allowed one of us to run across the street to grab a pastry and a couple of coffees to keep us warm while we waited :)\", \"I came here specifically for the honey butter pancakes, and they definitely lived up to the hype. They were light, moist, and perfectly balanced,not too sweet. Be warned though, they're pretty filling, so make sure you come hungry! I also tried the Korean fried chicken wings with gochujang sauce, and they were amazing. The service was fast, and the waiter was super friendly.

IMO, I think the cabbage slaw adds another crunch dimension to contrast the crunchy kats. It also prevented the sando from tasting super dry, but the katsu is on the drier side. \\n\\nKorean Fried Chicken Wings: meaty, juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside. The garlic gochujang glazed coated was addictively delicious. I could probably eat this all by myself and it\\'s relatively big portion too. It also came with picked daikon as a nice palette cleanser for balance.\\n\\nNext time, I\\'ll have to come back to try their \"breakfast\"items like their famous pancakes.', \"Good pancakes, long wait.\\n\\nThe viral pancakes are definitely delicious, super rich buttery,  compote, and sweet, sweet, sweet.  There is no doubt about the pancakes, they are D-E-V-I-N-E.  Would I like to eat these pancakes again?  Sure would!\\n\\nThe Egg Sando was also described as a must order but it was really bland to me.  The hashbrown provided a crunchy contrast in texture but was missing a sprinkle of salt as was the eggs.  Perhaps I should have requested the additional bacon as it seems flavor was definitely missing in action here without it.  I would have settled for some ketchup to be honest.\\n\\nThe waitress was great but other parts of the service left much to be desired.  Standing right next to the hostess stand (and I really do mean right next to the stand) for an extra 15 minutes waiting to be called, when I was supposed to be called already, was a bit clumsy.  I honestly spidey sensed that the hostess was bit off her game and sadly I was right.  I would have waited even longer if I didn't take the initiative to inquire about my name not being called.\", \"Saw these pancakes featured on my Yelp feed and had to have them immediately the next day! \\nI'm a waffle girlie, but restaurants don't use the thin roscoes or euro Belgian waffles I like so here I am drooling over unique cloud puffed pancakes. I loved the presentation along with the twist of honey butter over syrup & I loooove honey butter. The service was great...I got lucky with no wait but placed on a 35min timer. Lucky for them the pancakes were too sweet to eat the half I even forced, so 30mins was a good amount of time for my dine in. \\nThe double stack was enough to take home.\\nGo, enjoy!\", \"This was definitely a foodventure! We got to the restaurant at 9:50 am and the line was wrapped around the block (at least 50 people, I'd guess). We waited about 20 minutes to put our names in and were told a table would be ready in 1.5 to 2 hours. It ended up being closer to 1.5 hours (woo!). We got a text about an hour into the wait giving us 10 mins to respond if we wanted to stay on the waitlist. Then we got a warning text that our table would likely be ready in 30. Then we got a text very shortly after saying our table was ready and that we had 10 minutes to get there. We were not 10 minutes away so we hopped on some electric bikes and rushed back just in time to have our name called. Huzzah!\\n\\nThe vibes inside were very fun. It was lively but cozy and you could tell the employees were professionals. They ran that place like clockwork but somehow at the same time made you feel like they'd been waiting all day for you just like you'd been waiting all day to get in lol. \\n\\nFood was terrific! We got the pancakes with berry compote and the breakfast burrito with bacon. It was so much food even between 2 very hungry people. We ended up taking some of each home and it tasted just as good as leftovers. Do not sleep on the breakfast burrito. It's done perfectly. And of course, you can't come without getting the pancakes.\\n\\nNot sure if I can do that long of a wait again anytime soon, but I'll definitely be bringing my family and friends here next time they come visit the city!\", \"TLDR: 4.5/5: Classic diner experience with an asian twist that was a standout, with excellent portioned hot food served at a reasonable price. The hype is real (for the most part). \\n\\nReservations: I missed my window to book a reservation two weeks in advance (which is a non-negotiable btw!) so when I checked again it looked like it was fully booked the next month out. By the powers above we were able to snag a reservation at 10:30A. We were running to meet our reservation and could've easily been turned away since there was already a line that stretched half the block for walk-ins. Mind you, the place opens at 10. \\n\\nHave a reservation and be early. \\n\\nOrdered: \\n\\nOverall: Big portions here, everything can be considered shareable. \\n\\nHot Butter Pancakes ($13): 4.5/5 \\n- Yeahhh it lives up. I'd say this almost ties with Clinton St Baking. They are massively fluffy and light but also lowkey dense at the same time with how saturated they are. We requested the syrup on the side (which it is drowning in with it) and wo it already felt like enough going on. \\n\\n- Two things: I do not recommend having this on your own. You can easily split a pancake between 2 or 3 if you order more items. I saw too much pancake being left behind at other tables. \\n\\n- Second: I wouldn't recommend ordering a diff version of pancake. Go with the classic! I think also because it would be too much going on. \\n\\nTwo Eggs, How You Want Em ($13) : 4.7/5 \\n- This is a classic grand slam style meal. But holy cow I'm giving the hash brown just a 5 on their own. This is the kind of hash brown you want!! Seasoned, crunchy and piping hot! It I wasn't so full those would've cleared the plate much quicker. \\n\\nKorean Fried Chicken Wings ($17): 5/5\\nContrary to what others have said I actually enjoyed these a lot. The chicken was well seasoned and fairly big pieces of chicken (no party wings here!). There's always room to have more sauce but they were perfectly coated and had a nice kick to where the daikon was a great palette cleanser. \\n\\nAgain, completely sharable as it states. \\n\\nService: 5/5\\n\\nHave no complaints so I'd call it a 5! They were quick, pleasant and accommodative. \\n\\n\\nAmbiance: 4/5 \\nThis place screams cute diner. I love it. With that being said it is tinyyy. Due to NYC's outdoor seating law that is also gone. You will be in quite close quarters with the parties next to you so note that upon visiting if you are not comfortable. \\n\\nTransportation: 3/5 \\nIts in an odd place in Chinatown so consider some walking once you get off the station \\n\\n- \\nI don't crave breakfast to go out to eat it but I'd definitely take someone here just on the price and portions alone. It is not only reasonable, it is rare in the city.\", \"They weren't kidding when they say golden diner has the best pancakes in town and possibly the best chicken katsu too.\\n\\nPancakes were perfectly buttery and fluffy and rich. The chicken katsu tastes much better than it looks. \\n\\nSkip on the wings unless you're really hungry - they don't add too much value to the meal.\\n\\nService was typical of a actual diner. Ambiance is what it is (its in lower east side after all).\", 'Came here on a Sunday morning and had to wait about 1.5 hours, but is this place worth the wait? 1000% since you will leave happy and you also might cry after eating those pancakes. \\n\\nOur party started off savory, with the chicken katsu sando plate and the chinatown egg sando. The chicken katsu was delicious - it had a small slice of bread in between, but the flavors, especially the slaw, were on point.\\n\\nThe chinatown egg sando was amazing - buttery and cheesy scrambled eggs, a crispy (and not oily) hash brown, and the bun was phenomenal since it was a scallion and sesame bun and it was incredibly soft. I loved every bite of this sando and wished it was bigger. \\n\\nWe ended off with their famous pancakes with berry compote for dessert - I definitely recommend sharing this bad boy since they look light but are actually very filling. Drenched in this sweet honey butter with orange zest, I was literally crying at how good these were. I would come back time and time again for those cakes. \\n\\nThis diner is also super affordable for an NYC meal and the vibes are awesome. Must try!', \"Golden Diner is really good but if you're coming for breakfast on the weekend, you need to get in line an hour before they open, at 9am. Maybe 9:15. The place is tiny, I think it has 29 seats. So if you're not in the first 29ish patrons, you'll have to wait for everyone inside to finish their food. Don't even think about coming later than 10 because the wait will be hours long. My friend said she came at noon and the wait was 3-5 hours.\\n\\nThat being said, they serve all day breakfast, and you can make a reservation on weekdays, so if you're dying to try the viral honey butter pancakes without a wait, just go for dinner!\\n\\nNow for the food-- it's worth the hype. The pancakes are SO fluffy, moist, and delicious. The home fries should be served as snacks across the country. They're similar to Chick-fil-A's hashbrowns but less greasy. Bacon was nice and thick. I had their breakfast sando before and it was alright but I would skip it in favor of something else as the milk bun was a bit hard.\", 'Not good for groups as this restaurant is very small. I think this place is overly hyped. Not worth the 1hr 45mins wait. Just your average breakfast.. the honey pancake was overly sweet. I finished the whole bottle of water they provided along with the OJ that I ordered (it was that sweet).\\n\\nJust something to be mindful. Giving the limited number of tables, please have your meal and keep the chatting to a minimum. Give other patrons a fair chance and shorten everyones wait time. \\n\\nOnce and done.', \"Golden Diner's viral honey butter pancakes truly live up to the hype! \\n\\nWe first tried them last year on a trip to NYC, and they were unforgettable. We happened to get seats at the bar, which meant we had the unique experience of watching the pancakes being made right in front of us. When our order arrived, it was piping hot and perfect, with that slight crisp around the edges that's simply the best. The pancakes are enormous--tall, fluffy, and cake-like, drowning in warm berry compote and a melting slab of butter. Just heavenly.\\n\\nThis year, however, was a little different. We got an outdoor seat, and while the pancakes were still good, they didn't quite live up to last year's perfection. They were only lukewarm and a bit soggy as if they've been sitting on the counter too long. Not a huge deal, but just a little disappointing compared to that first experience.\\n\\nWe also tried the Chinatown egg and cheese sando with sausage. The fluffy sesame scallion milk bun paired wonderfully with the crispy hash brown and soft scrambled eggs. I found it a little weird that the sausage came out to be multiple cut-up sausage links though. \\n\\nReservations are highly recommended here. If you don't have one, plan to get there right at open to put your name on the list; otherwise, you're in for a ~2 hour wait. Luckily, Chinatown is just around the corner, so you can explore while you wait. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but note there's only one bathroom, so expect a bit of a line.\", \"Came here on a Saturday around 11:30am, they stopped taking names down for waitlist until 12:30, so we basically had to wait to wait and put our names down. Thankfully it was not too bad after we put our names down, the whole process took around an hour (which is not too terrible compared to some wait times).\\n\\nTheir most popular dishes are the Chinatown egg and cheese sando, pancakes and the katsu. We got the egg and cheese sando and breakfast burrito. \\n-egg and cheese sando: 3.5/5 ( a bit underwhelming). Soft scrambled egg with cheese is divine on its own, but sando as a whole is just okay... since there is a lot of bread (flavor is on the bland side). However once I ate each ingredient on its own, you can taste the subtle sweetness of the milk bread which is nice \\n\\n-breakfast burrito 4.5/5: the portion of this is huge! Flavors are on point too, would def recommend this over the sando\\n\\nOverall verdict: it was nice to try it once since this place is super hyped up, very affordable too, but don't think it's worth the wait\", \"I finally got to try the super popular Golden Diner and was well worth the wait. \\n\\nFirst, let's talk about how busy it is. I made reservations ahead of time about 2 and 1/2 weeks ahead and would strongly recommend it. I had other friends who tried to come with my friend and I but had to wait 3 hours for the next opening. \\n\\nComing into the restaurant, we were seated on the left side of the entrance which was a pretty high traffic zone going to and from the restroom. Even so, it was a nice place to watch all the action going on. \\n\\nFood-wise, we got several delicious items that were a mix of breakfast/brunch/Asian-inspired dishes:\\n\\n*Honey butter pancakes: Ridiculously doused in syrup yet so fluffy - it was a good amount of food for two people indeed and so highly recommended. It wasn't overpoweringly sweet with the syrup and the lemon zest just gives it a nice refreshing flavor. Have to try it.\\n\\n*Chicken katsu club: Also super filling - the katsu pieces were large and the chicken cutlet was cooked just right. Yes - it won't compete with some of the best katsu houses but it is sure darn tasty. My friend recommended getting the home fries which were also super crispy and delightful. Yum! \\n\\n*Omija Negroni: I got their plum soju negroni. Super solid and went perfectly with the food. They have numerous other spirits/beers/cocktails as well as coffee. What a mix. \\n\\nGolden Diner was a fantastic experience all-around - great food; great service; and great vibes. Would totally come back.\", 'Small diner so I recommend booking a reservation in advance.\\n\\nHoney Butter Pancake: 7/10. It was good and very filling but nothing special in my opinion. I added berries to it but it could use more syrup. \\n\\nChicken Katsu Club: 9/10. The sandwich was fantastic but I wish it had less cabbage. Highly recommend and big enough to share!', \"100% these pancakes are worth trying. You definitely need extra honey butter and they taste even better the next 1-2 days straight out of the fridge -- the taste begins to resemble a very dense pound cake.\\n\\nWe tried the chili crisp wedge salad - good but not exceptional, but definitely creative and a unique blending of flavors. Apparently the tuna melt is very good, but we didn't have it firsthand.\\n\\nThe pancakes, though... I get the hype.\", \"scampered down to chinatown just for these honey butter fluffs of heaven & every moment close to these sweet & sexy cakes was well worth the effort. \\n\\nwe popped in no res which i wouldn't recommend, but after an hour wait exploring chinatown (we considered getting tats while we waited but ended up heading back in case they called us early instead) we were seated & soon ready to order. \\n\\nour order: honey butter pancakes with berry compote & the golden omelette; the serving sizes are perfect for sharing. the berry topped flapjacks are divine & definitely triggered my happy dance with each delicious bite. \\n\\nwe also had the golden punch which is aptly named cuz i was nice & tipsy. overall, the vibes give a combo of cozy chaos & ill be sure to return to try those KFC wings!\", 'Make a reservation if you can as there are a limited number of tables. \\n\\nThe pancakes alone are absolutely worth the visit - fluffy, crispy and buttery. We got the berry compote on the side and it was the perfect burst of flavor. \\n\\nThe chicken katsu club on the other hand was a bit underwhelming. While visually pretty, I found the bread stale, which made it hard to enjoy the sandwhich.\\n\\nService was great and I always appreciate a restaurant that leaves a bottle of water on the table.', \"Had seen golden diner all over social media so dropped in one evening for dinner with 2 other people. We of course got the pancakes, also got the burger, the chicken wings, and the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The pancakes were just as fluffy in real life as they look on social media so I was very pleased with that. Overall, the food was pretty damn good, but nothing was amazing or mind blowing to me. It was definitely a great meal, but I think this place may be a LITTLE over hyped. I'm glad I was able to try this spot out, but I'm not in any rush to go back.\", \"As per a good amount of my recent reviews, I went to this place a good while ago. Our rather large group was sat outside as it was very crowded inside and as it was around early winter and a bit chilly, the heat lamps were on. While that of course was good for being comfortable, it also added a reddish tint to many of my photos. The seating was a bit cramped but fine for outside dining and the service was pretty fast with most of our dishes and friendly. The menu has fun Asian spins on the usual American diner food and some of it worked well while others were fine and in general the prices were a bit high but I guess it get passes for the creativity and most brunch spots tend to be a bit overpriced.\\n\\nTo drink, I had the Makgeolli Horchata with Korean rice wine and housemade horchata blend which had the faint unique sweetness from the rice wine but honestly as the quality of the horchata was good, I would almost prefer if they just offered that as a mocktail/agua fresca. Another person had the yuzu-ade which they liked.\\n\\nThe first thing that arrived was what they are famous for, the Honey Butter Pancakes for $15 with two fluffy pancakes served with honey maple butter finished with lemon zest. The pancakes were massive and quite fluffy and very rich especially with the delicious butter with the lemon zest adding a nice zing to help reduce the richness. I liked it a lot but I'm not sure if I could finish it alone as it was a bit overwhelming but I would recommend ordering this and maybe the katsu with one other and having a good meal with a good mix of flavors. I can see why it's probably the most well known thing here.\\n\\nSpeaking of Katsu, the Chicken Katsu Club for $19 with chicken cutlet, bacon, red cabbage slaw, katsu sauce, lettuce, and tomato was also very solid. There could have been a bit more katsu sauce but the chicken itself was moist and the cabbage slaw added some good crunch in addition to the crispy bacon. The sandwich was also divided on long skewers which made it easy to split. Overall tasty and a solid katsu though for katsu sandwiches, I prefer some other more traditional katsu sando spots such as the Asakusa Sando from J's Kitchen among others but it was still tasty. \\n\\nSurprisingly good was the Korean Fried Chicken Wings for $17 which are tossed in garlic gochujang glaze and served with pickled daikon. I didn't find them dry unlike some other people reviewing on here though I will agree that the saucing was a bit lighter than at some of the other spots such as in K-Town. I also would say that it's a bit too sweet and could use a bit more heat but it was still solid with nice big pieces of chicken and it's still tastes fresher/better than the to go spots like Olive BBQ. Also this spot doesn't charge for chikin-mu/pickled daikon which is a plus.\\n\\nWeakest but more for portion size compared to price was the rather generic Chinatown Egg & Cheese Sando for $13 with soft scrambled eggs, American cheese, and a hash brown patty served on a sesame scallion milk bun. The milk bun was fluffy and the hashbrown were fine but it's just not worth it. I think they would need to add something else (maybe some type of chili crisp or something) to add some extra flavor and make it more worth the $13.)\\n\\nWe otherwise shared all three desserts. While all were very tasty, my favorite of the bunch was the cheapest; the Green Tea Coffee Cake for $7 with matcha and hojicha. Nice crumbly cake with some bitterness from the matcha. \\n\\nThe other cake was the Thai Tea Tres Leches Cake for $11 with chantilly cream, toasted coconut, and lime zest. The Thai tea flavor was a tad light but the coconut and lime zest were both nice. The Pistachio Rice Puddin' for $11 with coconut milk, orange, and candied cardamom pistachios was also tasty. Nice crunch and a mix of nuttness and sweetness with some sourness. It was in short a very good take on rice pudding.\\n\\nTasty place. Not the best but I can see why they are popular. Low 4\", \"I've been following the hype of this place for some time now and we finally decided to give it a try. The wait time to sit in was over an hour so we decided to take it to go, even so it did not disappoint. The place itself is small, cute and very cozy. They have outside seating but because of the demand I would call or make a reservation in advance. \\nThe workers are quick and very attentive. The food is worth the hype. The pancake butter IS TO DIE FOR. I could eat this over and over again. I will point out the pancakes would be the reason I would come next time, they have a different texture than usual pancakes and it makes all the difference. I also had their iced coffee and LOVED it. Thanks for everything and I can't wait to come back.\", 'We came here for brunch on the weekend and there was already a line down the block before open so make sure to get there early! We put our name down and got seated around an hour later. I got the Chinatown egg and cheese sando and added sausage. It was god but didnt blow me away. We also got one order of the honey butter pancakes to share between six of us and it was plenty for us since it can be quite rich! The pancake was definitely a favorite and the texture is very fluffy', 'Golden Diner is the brainchild of Major Food Group and Momofuku Ko vet Samuel Yoo. The main attraction is diner food with an Asian accent. The kitchen in a traditional old school diner atmosphere covers the diner essentials and caters to the tastes of the Chinese, Latin, and increasingly veggie-happy neighborhood but does it with a tightly edited menu of just a dozen dishes or so. And yet, with everything from matcha coffee cakes to chicken katsu clubs, the range seems wide. \\n\\nGotta start with the Korean wings and patsy club and share the pancake for dessert.\\n\\n\\nCheers', \"Went this morning at 10:30am with a reservation. We sat down as soon as we arrived and ordered a few dishes. \\n\\nWe ordered the honey butter packakes with fruits, Chinatown egg sando, Sam's tuna melt, & the Korean fried chicken wings.\\n\\nWe loved everything. The Chinatown egg sando wasn't our favorite compared to the other items. We wish we ordered two of the tuna melts instead.The pancakes were delicious and the wings were tasty. \\n\\nThe service was quick and friendly. The restaurant only has one bathroom.\\n\\nWe will go back again.\", \"We had a reservation but had to wait a bit before being seated. The restaurant is very small and casual. There is one bathroom and there was always someone waiting to use it. The service was fine and the food came out in a reasonable time. \\n\\nThe Korean Fried Chicken Wings had a flavorful crunchy exterior and gernerous chunks of meat. The cabbage slaw went well with the Chicken Katsu Club.  If I came back, I would order the wings and the katsu club again!   The Golden Cheeseburger was good, but nothing special in my opinion. The fries and home fries were crunchy out the outside and soft on the inside, but also nothing special. The Honey Butter Pancakes were fluffy and filling. We shared one order for the table. The syrup had a unique taste, but I couldn't figure out what it was. We got the berry compote but wish the portion size of the compote was larger. Overall they offer unique and affordable options and I would go back if I was in the area.\", 'Korean wings are very flavorful and crispy. Got in on a weekend when it first opened, following an early spin class. Also ordered the infamous pancake, which while good was extremely rich.  Would come back but would not wait in a line to do so when I could just go to Bubby\\'s or something and not wait at all. Service was interesting, reminded me of the servers that used to be so commonplace in Williamsburg during its hipster heyday, but I guess this is close to...eye roll \"Dimes Square.\" Playlist during brunch was fire.', 'I did not make a reservation for the Golden Diner ( big mistake). I arrived and was informed that it would be a two hour wait! After receiving this news two women were walking in to be seated and told me it is worth the wait! So. I said okay I will wait the two hours. I gave my phone number and was informed that when I get the text that the table is ready I had to be back within 10 minutes. I visited a local coffee shop to wait out the two hours. \\nIt is a small restaurant and seats about 20 to 30 people. There was never an empty seat as a party leaves another  party would enter to take those seats. I was seated on the stool facing the chefs. I ordered the hot honey pancakes and Korean fried chicken wings served with pickled daikon.  Everything was delicious! The lemon zest is a great touch to the pancakes. For me it helped cut some of the sweetness from the honey butter. My first time ever trying pickled daikon but it paired well with the wings. Facing the chefs while I ate was a cool experience. The Golden Diner makes sure the food is seasoned as intended before sending the food out. For example, I was watching the preparation of the Caesar salad and the sous chef and chef would taste the salad , add to it, and continue that process until it was perfect! This was a great NYC experience!', 'Am I seriously going to be review #700 for this restaurant? Wow! Awesome! Alright!\\n\\nHere are some remarks concerning some of the food in this Korean/American fusion diner under Manhattan Bridge. You can tell you are under the bridge not just by looking at it, but hearing the subways rumble over your head every few seconds as you are eating.\\n\\nNow that I got the location out of the way, I can talk about what you really want to read about, the food.\\n\\nRather the pancakes, yes, the pancakes.\\n\\nThe pancakes here are unlike most that you will try in the city. Fluffy, heavy, two to a plate, but you will be unable to finish them. Each table I saw that ordered them left some on their plates. Yes, getting the compote with it is compulsory, despite the fact it does cost extra.\\n\\nYou will need something else to balance out your palette though, because the heavy pancake will expand and ruin everything you worked for that day. I got two pieces of bacon and eggs to make it a breakfast for dinner deal. The eggs are fine, but the bacon is a little dry.\\n\\nThat is why I had a backup plan, the wings. Provided you get eight with an order, the wings are white, meaty, crispy, almost like a duck sauce fry to them. They provide you with wet towelettes and a cup to throw the bones and waste into. That is nice.\\n\\nIt is also nice that a cute girl who was seated at the bar only a few stools away from me held my hand (metaphorically speaking) through my entire dining experience to ensure I ordered and ate everything correctly. I never got her name, but that is okay. The nameless heroes are the ones that we end up admiring the most anyway.\\n\\nBased on the crowds that were coming in, come here on an off time during the weekday. Weekends will just have you waiting insufferably too long for their food.\\n\\nWhich would only be an insult towards your stomach.', 'My sister wanted to get breakfast here this past weekend since we skipped it the last time she came to visit! We were quoted a 1.5hr wait (long wait times are typical) so we decided to get takeout instead and ate at a nearby park. \\n\\nEach ordered a Chinatown Egg & Cheese Sandwich + order of Honey Butter Pancakes with Blueberry Compote (+$4). \\n\\nWas a bit let down by the milk bun for our breakfast sandwiches as neither the sesame nor the scallion flavors were very pronounced. Very good overall though. But those pancakes were worth the hype!! Super lemony glaze + honey maple butter + warm blueberry compote... each bite was fabulous and I need 2 more of them as I type this. \\n\\nTheir to-go packaging/process needs tweaking -- bigger platters for pancakes, attention to detail with adding requested silverware and napkins.', \"Came here when it was raining so I didn't think the wait would be long. Jokes on me, they were so busy! We ended up waiting for about 40 minutes. Plenty of time to know what I want to order. \\n\\nHad some chicken wings - which was my favorite part of the meal. Really good flavor, crispiness, and the chicken was juicy. Also had one pancake. Really good pancake, very fluffy and drenched in honey. It's a must to try at least one pancake, which is actually plenty for 2 people. It's large!\", 'My friends and I came here on a Friday evening and were able to be seated right away on the counter. The wait for a table of 4 was about 30-45 minutes. he counter allowed us to see all of the food being prepared. It definitely has a diner atmosphere, including the bad coffee. I do enjoy that they have natural wines.\\n\\nWe heard about the pancakes, but it was actually was not our favorite. I believe our pancakes were undercooked. They were were less fluffy, and the center was more doughy with a similar texture to mochi. However, the honey butter with lemon zest made the pancakes standout. We really enjoyed the golden cheeseburger with the mushroom gochujang sauce. In addition to the golden cheeseburger, we \"made it deluxe\" with the fries/pickle and home fries/pickle which was an additional $5 and $6 each, relatively. Both fries and home fries were good, but the addition was a bit expensive especially, since the home fries were actually just cut up hash browns. \\n\\nI would suggest popping in if you are in the area, but wouldn\\'t make it a destination since surrounding area isn\\'t very nice and it\\'s a bit pricey for a diner.', \"Came across Golden Diner on Instagram and had to see what the hype was about. We were on a food tour in Chinatown so we were only here to try the Honey Butter Pancakes. We arrived shortly before 5:00pm and had our choice of indoor or outdoor seating. The weather was amazing so we chose outside, however this was a mistake because it's right next to a bridge and it was sooo loud the whole time. Didn't get a great vibe from the hostess (who also waited on us). The whole meal felt very rushed as if they needed our table even though we were the only people eating outside. For this reason I gave them 3 stars. \\n\\nThe pancakes came out really fast and were definitely fresh. They were really unique and delicious but also pretty rich! I'm glad we shared because one whole order would've been way too much for me. I would say it was worth the try but nothing I'm racing to go back for.\", \"Y'all, these pancakes.... Moment of silence. If you do not like sweet things then you would not like these pancakes. Soaked in the honey butter syrup, but if you love sweets you will be in heaven. It's so rich and fluffy. \\nThe wings also a home run. Nice and sticky sauce \\nInside is so tiny so I understand why the long wait. \\nBut definitely worth the hype!\", \"The 2.5 hour wait is really not it, but the food makes you want to come back. There's no reservations for brunch, so if you're planning to come here (especially on the weekends), prepare to wait about 20 minutes just to add yourself onto the waitlist in-person, and then expected to wait another 2-2.5hours before your table is ready. I recommend exploring Chinatown during this time. You can make reservations for dinner though, and I believe they also serve the brunch menu all day.\\n\\nIf you can get past the wait, the food is honestly well worth the hype. The honey butter pancakes with berry compote is out of this world - and I'd rate it my favorite pancakes I've ever had. The chicken katsu club is also delightful.\", \"I am not a pancake person, but I am a huge fan of the honey butter pancakes here!\\n\\nAs other reviews (and even their website) have mentioned, they do not take reservations on weekends and the waitlist can get very long. If you're available on a weekday, do yourself a favor and make a reservation then. We arrived around noon on a Saturday and waited almost exactly 1.5 hours before getting two seats at the bar.\\n\\nTwo of us split an order of the honey butter pancakes ($15) with the added berry compote (+$4) and also got a side of bacon ($5) to balance out the sweetness. I was super curious about the Chinatown egg & cheese sando but I am glad I did not get it because the pancakes ended up being more than enough food for two hungry people. I will have to come back again to try the sando.\\n\\nI was afraid that the pancakes would be too dry or cooked unevenly due to their thickness, but they were perfect. They had a crispy, toasty surface with a very fluffy interior. Despite their thickness, the pancakes were actually not too dense. The texture was somewhere between a standard American pancake and a Japanese souffle pancake. I am glad we got the berry compote because the honey maple butter was very sweet. The subtle tartness from the berries really helped balance out the heaviness of the honey maple butter. If I were to get the pancakes again, I would also get the bacon again! I loved how the crispy, salty bacon added a new dimension to the pancakes.\\n\\nThe service was fast but they never rushed us despite having a long list of people waiting outside. Sitting at the bar was fun because I could watch all the orders getting prepared.\", \"I happened to snag a reservation early morning on Monday. There was a line out the door of folks waiting to get seated without one. Inside is smaller than I had originally thought with very old school diner decor. I was seated quickly and ordered honey butter pancakes with berry compote, egg sando with the works, green tea coffee cake, home fries, and yuzuades. The food was good, but obviously the pancakes were the star. It was super fluffy and huge! Order one to share for the table if you're coming as party of two.\", \"Let's get straight to it - the honey butter pancakes are great. If you wanna come here for brunch you'll definitely need to line up or show up 30 minutes before opening to get in right away. The interior itself is small and looks just like a diner. There are some cute Korean fusion touches throughout the restaurant. \\n\\nThe honey butter pancakes come with a compote for an additional $4 and they are necessary otherwise the pancakes are just drenched in butter. I shared the pancakes and the wings with a friend and the wings were really nice and crispy. A nice sweet and savory combo.\", 'The pancakes were huge and moist and thick but light.  There was endless coffee pour .  The cabbage sandwich was phenomenal!!  I want to go back!', \"It looks like I'll be lining them up and knocking them down while I'm in New York. \\nThis place served one of the best pancakes I've ever tasted; I would quickly put theirs in my top three.\\nEverything else on the menu was good, but the pancakes stood out.\\nI have to ask myself, is a great pancake enough to warrant a great review?\\nI guess so \\nBB\", \"I love Golden Diner!\\n\\nI've gotten delivery several times and it always comes packed so nicely. I finally came to eat for 4 on a Thursday night. I was able to get a reservation for the outdoor patio at 7pm, and it looked like there was some walk-in seating available indoors, too.\\n\\nI've ordered the burrito, wings, chicken katsu club, egg sandwich, and matzo ball soup. I tried the cheeseburger and pancakes when I visited, and they were delicious. The desserts are amazing, I love the coffee cake and tres leches cake. I need to try the rice pudding.\\n\\nWe were celebrating a birthday, and they comped us a slice of coffee cake. \\n\\nVery friendly, quick service!\\n\\nWould love to sit inside next time, it looked nice inside when I went to use the bathroom.\", 'Had a nice time at Golden Diner. I went with a few friends and we ordered many items such as the pancakes, breakfast platters, as well as a special which was a pork chop and curry stir fry over rice. The special was delicious, and I would be curious to hear what other specials Golden Diner has as well as how often specials change! The pancakes were decent, I enjoyed the tinge of honey flavor from the syrup used. Finally, the breakfast platters were a bit underwhelming. Including home fries, eggs and toast at $15 felt a bit pushy, and to add sausage/meat would have added another $4. I would definitely come back to try more unique dishes though!', \"I've been hearing about this spot for ages, but have always been deterred by the lines. I found myself in the two bridges/chinatown area after a haircut, so decided to try my luck, and thankfully on a Thursday around 6:15 there was no wait to sit at the bar for 2! After sitting down, a table opened up and the server said we could move as long as we were out within an hour- hooray! It's definitely a smaller space, which makes sense for how crowded I've heard it gets on the weekends...\\n\\nThey still serve some of their breakfast faves for dinner, and so we ordered the Honey Butter Pancakes and their Chinatown Egg and Cheese Sando with fries + pickle. The food comes out super fast. \\n\\nThe Egg and Cheese was superb- on this delicious scallion milk bun with a crispy hash brown that gives some texture and crunch. The eggs themselves are soft and perfect. This was definitely my favorite bite. The fries were hot and crispy and the pickle was a nice balance of acidity to cut through the flavors. \\n\\nThe Honey Butter Pancakes were incredibly thick and sweet! They're undoubtedly good pancakes, but I found the honey butter topping to be too sweet for me. My partner absolutely loved them tho- so if you have a sweet tooth then these are it! \\n\\nOverall I'm glad I tried Golden Diner out! Service is really friendly and fast here. The egg & cheese was amazing and pancakes are worth trying at least once. Not worth waiting in line for IMO but I would come back for a chill weeknight dinner (esp w a resy!). They take resys on the weekdays for brunch and dinner, highly recommend!\", \"Came back one year later, and wow this place somehow got even more popular! They don't take reservations on the weekend, which could be a good or bad thing depending how you look at it. We came by at ~ 2PM on Saturday and still ended up having to wait for an hour. The outdoor seating area is a little nicer than the indoor seating in my opinion just because it can get really cramped inside. \\n\\nWe ordered the honey butter pancakes with berry compote and chicken katsu club (which happened to be the same exact thing I ordered last year). The club was just as good as I remembered- the slaw was tasty and the katsu surprisingly didn't get soggy. While it's an intimidatingly thick sandwich, the bread is thin so it's easy to compress it to get a full bite. The honey butter pancakes were also great! The pancake texture is almost somewhere between typical pancakes and cake and the honey butter and berry compote really pair nicely. I ended up taking some leftover pancakes home and while definitely nowhere near as good as when they are fresh, the leftovers soaked up the honey butter and it was super yummy. \\n\\nThe food came out really fast and service was super efficient! The wait time can be a bit of a bummer, but I would suggest walking around Chinatown to pass the time.\", \"I really wanted to like it but unfortunately had a pretty disappointing breakfast here. The staff was kind and efficient but the food was subpar. I waited a little over an hour to eat here so I was pretty excited to get to try Golden Diner. I think after this experience I won't be back. \\n\\nFood-  The pancakes were the best dish I had but not good enough to make me come back. I'm positive there are plenty of better hotstacks in NYC. Pancakes get a whopping 3/5. The grilled cheese and tomato kimchi soup sounded like it would be amazing. I don't know how that messed that up but they did. Extremely greasy bread and the soup was also oily. The sandwich left that shiny oil residue on my fingers, yuck. 2/5\", \"Food is super good. Came for the pancakes and it didn't disappoint. The pancakes were much bigger in person and two people could only eat about half or little over half. Best Kats's sandwich ever though. I also love the presentation of the club sandwiches. \\n\\nOutside eating experience is not great, barely can hear with everyone talking, loud noises outside with the trains. We couldn't get seating inside so can't speak to how the dining experience is inside. They don't have a lot of seating so if you come on a weekend for brunch, you'll have to wait 2 hours minimum. You can put your name down though and they will text you when it's ready but you have to be there in 10 mins to get your table. \\n\\nWe went around 8pm on a week night and we didn't have to wait. I don't love the area, it feels a little sketchy but it's not that bad where I wouldn't go again. \\n\\nI highly recommend this place and definitely get the pancakes!\", \"Food: \\n- Honey Butter Pancakes 10/10\\n- Chicken Katsu Club 8/10\\n- Chinatown Egg & Cheese Sando 8/10\\n\\nCan't stop thinking about those pancakes...they were so fluffy and the syrup was a delicious mix. Kind of a small place but we were lucky to get a table--might need to reserve in advance. Staff were super friendly!\", \"On my recent trip to  NY, I was in search of a good place to eat for breakfast. I immediately went to Tik Tok and found a place called Golden Diner. A short walk from our hotel, we got there met by a line going around the block. When we got to the door, we were told it was an hour wait. So wait we did. Once we got inside, the  diner is quite small and I better understood why the wait was so long. There is outside seating but those were also full. \\n   The diner is standard American fare with a Korean twist. I started with the golden punch, a spiked plum punch that was quite good and also quite strong. I got the breakfast burrito which was just ok. But the star of the show were the pancakes. Literally the best pancakes I have ever had. Ever. Thick, fluffy, dense, moist, it was a cross between a cake and a normal pancake. Drenched in honey butter with lemon zest sprinkled on top.... It was heavenly. I couldn't finish them, and that made me sad because they were so good. lol. I asked the server how they got the pancakes to that consistency and no one would tell. Golden Diner... I will be back, and I will figure out how to make pancakes like that at home.\"]}, {'id': 'ejdQq4SvCv-qE7qSYhtVoA', 'name': 'Mama Lee - Williamsburg', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bMOoSrP1tY3D6NLhf4nAUw/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://www.mamaleerestaurant.com', 'display_address': '66 Grand St', 'display_phone': '(718) 683-9820', 'rating': 4.5, 'reviews': [\"5/5 for hospitality and service. We're so grateful we were able to meet THE Mama Lee herself on a Friday evening! They were severely shortstaffed, but she still managed to make us all feel at home. \\n\\nThe Taiwanese staples she dishes up here were all delicious. We loved both the Three Cup Chicken and the Lu Rou Fan. The Three Cup Chicken was so fragrant thanks to the stir-fried basil. The Lu Rou Fan came with sliced simmered radishes and something pickled that contrasted well with the richness of the pork. \\n\\nWe were so shocked when she dropped off hot chicken noodle soup at the end of our meal. We thought she'd made a mistake initially, but it's actually just part of her hospitality. The broth was hot and comforting and included a generous portion of chicken and carrots. It was the perfect way to cap off our meal. Dining at Mama Lee's is like being embraced in a warm hug.\", \"Mama Lee serves great hopitality with sides of decent bites in a warm, cozy atmosphere.\\n\\nWe came to Mama Lee on a cold day after wandering around Williamsburg, enticed by the thought of a home cooked Taiwanese meal. We were served very nicely and attentively throughout our meal, and even offered a free drink to take out at the end! A very welcome bonus at any restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered the Taiwanese sausage, cold vegetables, and Lu Rou Fan. Each dish was below the average of what we expected; we've all defintely had better at other places around NYC. Most importantly though, it was much more expensive than anticipated. Part of that maybe due to it being in Williamsburg where everything is more than expected, but still we would think a homestyle meal could lean on the affordable side.\", \"No frills restaurant but in a beautiful space. They have one big table so it could be good for groups; I would call ahead.\\n\\nIt's run by Mama Lee herself, and the dishes are fresh. She gave us everything we needed and everything was tasty.\", \"Treated by Mama Lee herself! Sweetest lady with the best service -- she even refilled our beef noodle soup broth when it ran low. They're doing a lot with what looks like a tight staff.\\n\\nEnjoyed the beef noodle soup & lu rou fan but was especially wowed by the salt & pepper fried pork chops. What moreish seasoning -- couldn't stop gnawing at em. A must-get in my book.\", \"Come here not just for the amazing food but also to experience the Taiwanese hospitality! We met Mama Lee when dining in, she's so sweet.\\n\\nThe interior is simplistic while modern. The food is Taiwanese food but with a twist. For example, I was surprised by the shacha sauce used on top of the classic Lu Rou Fan (braised pork rice). The salt and pepper chicken was also not cooked the typical way as well, but I love her style much better! The batter was light and not overly greasy. I love the complimentary daikon soup they provide in the beginning. (which is actually quite common in Taiwan for meals to come with a complimentary soup at smaller shops/bento shops). The stewed chicken in the soup falls right off the bone - the ultimate comfort food! It does feel like the cooking comes from a mom's recipe. \\n\\nHighly recommend! :)\\n\\nOne small suggestion though - if they can play Taiwanese/Mandarin music in the background, it would bring the experience to the next level!\", 'WHAT A GEM OF A SPOT!!! The food was absolutely delicious - fresh and hot. The dumplings were crispy and juicy and the sauce was uniquely tangy. The lu rou fan tasted homemade and the pork was so tender. The salt and pepper chicken was delightfully crispy (without feeling greasy!). The owner was also so sweet and offered us complimentary tea and checked in to see if we needed additional rice. The restaurant is homey and decorated simply and sweet. I love this place.', 'Saw this place as we were walking around Williamsburg. At first we werent even sure if they were open.\\n\\nWalked in and ambiance was much diff than expected..bright and super minimalistic clean modern interior. \\n\\nMenu was fairly simple which is always a plus. Ordered beef noodle soup, cucumber salad, and popcorn chicken. \\n\\n1. Cucumber salad (3/5) crunch but too watery and saucy and a bit bland\\n2. BnS (3.5/5) good flavor but noodles were overcooked\\n3. Chicken (2/5) too greasy and had no flavor except for strong fried msg smell that mimicked churros.\\n\\nService was good (only 1 server working when we went but she was very nice and fast) but food was not impressive. Dont think i will go back.', \"They've changed their setup since initial opening to be more of a sitdown service vibe, so you can directly interact with Mama Lee herself! Most of the clientele is families or couples. \\n\\nSuch great customer service and we enjoyed chatting with her! The food is so delicious with the homemade touch and is deserving of more attention. \\n\\nThis time we ordered the fried rice, salt & pepper fried fish, and she also had us try some of their soup which was so delicious and healthy. Portions are consistently large which is great for sharing.\\n\\nGlad to have this option available to us\", 'Yummy taiwanese food and friendly service! They have good lunch specials which are bento boxes. The aesthetic of the restaurant are on point too', \"Came to Mama Lee for lunch. For a party of 2, we shared the Taiwanese Beef Noodle and Salt and Pepper chicken. The broth was perfectly flavored and the beef was so tender. Noodle was cooked just right. The salt and pepper chicken was hot and fresh and tasty! Mama Lee also brought us her homemade Taiwanese sausage to try, so good with rice.  While the price is a little high, the portion is generous and for two of us, we couldn't finish.\", 'We love the nourishing and satisfying dishes here. It was our treat to meet Mama Lee herself at our last visit. Sincerely hoping the restaurant reopens in January- this is one of our favorite places to eat in the neighborhood.', \"I have nothing but good things to say about Mama Lee! When we first arrived, we were skeptical of the authenticity as it's located in a pretty hip, open space with eclectic art. However, we were pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nThe food is delicious, with massive portions. Everything was so flavorful. We ordered the Lu Rau Fon, which was labeled as a small plate, but definitely could've been a full meal. It came with a tea egg, veggies, and pickled vegetables, as well as the fattiest pork belly that melted in your mouth. We also got the dumplings, which came with a spicy chili oil dipping sauce and were double the size of normal dumplings. We also ordered the salt and pepper pork chop. They came out as 3 massive, and perfectly crispy, pork chops. They were easily the best part of the meal. The food is all very home-style cooking, making it very comforting. \\n\\nWe thought the dishes were on the pricey side, as the pork chops were almost $30, but it was well worth the price. They brought out a complimentary chicken and radish soup, which was a nice surprise. It was delicious and a great starter. The rice is also complimentary which we appreciated. Mama Lee herself came out and was incredibly friendly. She told us to ask her for more soup if we ran out and if we needed anything. She even ran to open the door for us when we were leaving! I was amazed by how friendly and hands-on she was with everything. When she packed our leftovers, she added an extra tea egg as well! You can tell that she really cares about this place and everyone's experiences. \\n\\nThis is an incredible place and I'd love to come back to support it!\", \"Mama Lee has some of the best service in Williamsburg! She was so kind and kept checking in on my party during our meal. The restaurant is very modern and minimalistic. I liked the Fish a lot but I wish there was a sauce that went with the dish. The Chicken Eggplant was saucy and good. The Lu Rou Fan wasn't bad but I would have liked it more if there was more fat in the meat.\\n\\nI definitely recommend this place for their service!\", 'We\\'ve been wanting to try Mama Lee since they opened their location in Williamsburg a few months ago, in late spring of 2023. Described as \"home-style, traditional Taiwanese food\", Mama Lee recently started offering à la carte[1], and we had the opportunity to try a few of their dishes for lunch.\\n\\nOccupying a double-decker space with really high ceilings near Domino Park, the dining area has a minimalist vibe that feels unpretentious and welcoming.\\n\\nWe started our meal with Lu Rou Fan, a Taiwanese comfort food classic of braised pork belly over rice. This version also included half a hard boiled egg, and it was truly delicious. This was perhaps the dish I liked the most of the ones we tried.\\n\\nThe other dishes we had were the Beef Noodle Soup, and the Eggplant with Chicken. The Beef Noodle Soup was excellent: the broth is flavorful, the noodles are chewy, and it has a nice balance between meat and veggies. The chicken in the Eggplant dish is crispy and sweet on the outside, and tender on the inside.\\n\\nAlso, if you like beer, there is an interesting selection of Taiwanese beers in a can.\\n\\nI can\\'t wait to come back! As everything we tried was great, I just want to try all the other dishes on the menu.\\n---------------------------------------\\n[1] Apparently, if you make a reservation through their IG page and request the \"secret menu\", they will prepare a surprise meal based on the ingredients available that day. 4 people minimum; you pay per person.', \"Mama Lee is a homey, warm, wholesome, and cozy Taiwanese Restaurant located at 66 Grand Street in Brooklyn, NY. I do not go to Brooklyn often and was so lucky to find and try Mama Lee. \\n\\nMy friends and I walked in on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm. Once you open the door, there is a large waiting area. We walked up the steps and Mama Lee greeted us and brought us to our table. There were only 2-3 empty tables at this time and busy with groups. The restaurant has a modern design and very spacious. Mama Lee took our order and our food came out in no time. She asked if we wanted rice and bought us complimentary soup which had a chicken drumstick, carrots, and daikon radish. The soup was so delicious and light.\\n\\nWe ordered Cucumber with special sauce, Lu Rou Fan, Shacha Beef, and Three Cup Chicken. All the dishes were flavorful, mouthwatering, and portions were wonderful for sharing. My favorite was the Three Cup Chicken. Three cup chicken or san bei ji is one of the most classic Taiwanese recipes and I was really looking forward to trying it. The outer part of the chicken was crispy and inside was moist. What makes three cup chicken is the sauce which is a cup each of the three ingredients: rice wine, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Each bite was delicious. \\n\\nMama Lee was busy doing everything. She was seating guests, doing takeout orders, bringing dishes out, checking in to see if guests wanted additional dishes and how it was going, checking out guests, and so much more. She had a smile on the whole time and offered superb hospitality. It felt like I was eating at home and had a wonderful time. I highly recommend everyone to go to Mama Lee. You'll have a great time!\", \"I'm a sucker for Taiwanese food so decided to check out Mama Lee. Unfortunately they annoyingly don't offer an a la carte menu and only offer a set at $55/person (or something like that). You get 1 starter, 1 main, and a dessert. Annoyingly, they don't give you a proper menu to know what you're going to get. The server wasn't very helpful either and pretty much just said: rice or noodles for starters; pork, chicken, beef, veg for main but wouldn't give us any clue as to what we're going to get. That said, knew I had to ask for that popcorn chicken. \\n\\nWent with a friend so we split everything and got 2 choices for each:\\n1. Soup: some chicken soup that was very homey\\n2. Beef noodle soup: beef was tender; noodles were too soggy and overcooked \\n3. Lu rou fan: fatty, meh, standard \\n4. Popcorn chicken: good stuff. Could be better with some dipping sitch \\n5. Egg tart: not the best I've had. Custardy. Tart shell could be more crisp since it was kinda soggy\\n\\nOverall, Mama Lee is okay if you want home cooked feels and Taiwanese food. Is it the best? Nah. Also pretty pricey with that set menu imo. Would I come back? Nope, I'd rather go to 886 or check out another place. Food is decent (nothing amazing- just aight) but minus cause of the inflexible option to only get the set and the service when they were explaining the menu. More 3.75 vs 4\", \"Finally got around to trying Mama Lee in Williamsburg. I know this is their second location and I personally have not been to their other location but was excited just by the fact that I am a sucker for Taiwanese food. \\n\\nDidn't see an online reservation system so walked in on a Friday evening around 6:30 and had no issues getting a seat. It seems that the front area has an order at the counter/takeout situation going on while the back area past the steps is table service. The space is serene and minimal and service was great, it made me feel like I was dining in someones home rather than a restaurant which I loved. For two people we ordered three dishes-- the fried dumplings, pork belly over rice bowl, and three cup chicken. Dumplings were probably my personal favorite! I've never had fried dumplings with such an absorbent outer layer. Mind blowing! Three cup chicken was also delicious and it comes with broccoli which wasn't overcooked and still nice and crunchy. I was a big fan of the pork belly bowl as well but felt it was harder to share but think it would be a great solo dining/lunch option. They came around with complimentary strawberry smoothies as well!!! Super refreshing for summer :)\", \"Charming Taiwanese in Williamsburg with a lot of meals that remind me of home cooked meals. The food and decor are great, the service is also excellent given sometimes you are being served by Mama Lee herself. \\n\\nI'd say eating here in the restaurant provides a better experience than taking out as I felt the quality wasn't exactly the same.\\n\\nThe beef noodle soup is extremely hearty, the lu rou fan had alot of extras in it that I wouldn't get at other restaurants like veggies on the side (can be good or bad depending on your preference), and the bamboo stir fry dish is excellent.\\n\\nThe only negative feedback I have is the price per dish. This restaurant is on the more expensive side with dishes costing $20+ easily.\", 'Food (4 stars):\\nMy favorite is the 3 cup chicken and the beef noodle soup. Fried rice was good but nothing crazy. Salt and pepper chicken is really good and crispy, as well. The chicken raddish soup is really good, as well!', \"3.75, rounding up to 4. \\n\\nThe front is decorated with lots of cute prints of Taiwanese food + scenes! You order and pay first in the front, then eat in the back. Service was a little slow, but there was only one person hustling back and forth between the kitchen and tables.\\n\\nBeef noodle soup (3/5): The overall flavor wasn't anything special. Broth was on the heavier side. I do like that they give plenty of veggies with it.\\n\\nSalt + pepper shrimp (4/5): Very simple flavor. I enjoyed that the legs were fried enough that you could eat them. However, it's on the saltier side so definitely need rice.\\n\\nWater cress veggies (4/5): They give LOTS of this. Definitely will last two meals across two people. \\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend this place if you want a simple, straightforward Taiwanese meal.\", 'Got the Lou rou fan and the three cup chicken, super good and fresh food. Service is good and fast, fairly causal dine in spot.', 'The owner was so nice and the food was so flavorful and balanced.\\n\\nVery cute decor too ! Very homie', 'At a higher price point but very nice space and superb friendly service, @mamaleeofficialrestaurant in Williamsburg serves you home cooking style Taiwanese food! Still heavier and more oily than at home, but the way they were prepped reminds you of a home cooked meal and warms your heart!', \"was recommended mama lee by my roommate, she went back when they were doing a set menu. we walked in for lunch around 2 on a saturday and it was pretty busy, but we got a table in under 5 minutes? almost instant. the vibe is nice, everyone is really very welcoming, the lighting is bright without being fluorescent, and the decor and plants are very tasteful. there were definitely families there which is a good sign \\n\\nwe ordered: \\n3 cup chicken (sam bei ji)\\nmarinated pork rice (lu rou fan)\\nfried dumplings\\nand an auntie gave us a free bowl of chicken bone \\n\\nthe dumplings were really crispy and the filling was soooo good. we had 6 for like 12 or 13, which isn't bad for 6, especially outside of chinatown. i also really liked the 3 cup chicken, id never had it before but my taiwanese lunch compatriote said it was very good. however for both of us, the star of the show was definitely the lu rou fan  it was probably the best lu rou fan i've had. the marinade was top notch. i think there could have been more rice, but the ratio of pickled vegetables to meat was perfect  it was definitely one of their cheaper items so that makes sense why the portion was a little smaller though, but would definitely recommend trying!\\n\\ni think what boosted the experience for both of us was hearing about the backstory of the restaurant and the mission from our waiter, who i think maybe owns it. he told us that they aim to serve home cooked, but premium, taiwanese food and introduce america to premium asian cooking. he also let us know that they switched owners and such had to switch the menu and chefs back in september. i'm glad we got to try it after the switch  definitely come through and support. it's great to see a taiwanese family owned business in south williamsburg; they're so passionate about what they do (and they do it well!!)\", 'Pros:\\n- Great location in Williamsburg next to Domino Park\\n- Minimalist modern space with high ceilings \\n- I love the Beef Noodle Soup (huge pieces of beef brisket), Three Cup Chicken, and Lu Rou Braised Pork Rice \\n\\nCons:\\n- The prices here are jaw-droppingly exorbitant ($28 for a single beef noodle soup! Gotta pay for that Williamsburg rent :( ) The saving grace is the attentive and sweet Mama Lee herself coming out and providing complimentary dishes during your meal.', \"We went to this Mama Lee's restaurant in Williamsburg, and I was surprised at the astronomical prices for dishes:  $18 for Taiwanese sausage, $25 for Bok Choy, $25 for Tomato Egg, that's absolutely absurd!  \\n\\nI ordered 3-cup chicken. I couldn't recognize it. Chicken was battered and stir fried. Authentic Taiwanese, the chicken is stewed or casserole, has recognizable spices and chestnuts. This was nothing resembling the dish. \\n\\nLou Ron Fan, is another dish that I didn't recognize. The food is awful. It is unfortunate ... I am Taiwanese and I used to eat the food from Mama Lee's at the original Bayside Queens location. This is nothing like the original establishment. Avoid at all costs !!!\", \"hands down the most homey meal you can find in NYC. from service to food to ambiance/vibes, you will feel like you're eating a homecooked meal upon returning home!!\\n\\nthe food was DELICIOUS, well made, very generous portions, and Mama Lee herself walks around the restaurant and makes sure all her customers are taken care of. She came around and served us hot tea and free dishes!!! Such a sweet sweet human. Would come here just to see and support her!!!\\n\\nWe got the beef noodles (AMAZINGGGG, noodle texture was perfect and soup was so well flavored), three cup chicken (fried chicken texture with sweet/savory sauce coating), shrimp egg (SO UMAMI it's crazy), shacha beef, sweet and sour soup...all delicious!! i recommend them all! you can't go wrong here. So unfortunate that they sold out of desserts for the day (we went on a sunday around 7pm) so come early!!!\\n\\nif you want the best homey meal while supporting the cutest Mama Lee and her local business, don't miss out on this place!!!!!\", \"I have very mixed feelings writing this review.\\n\\nOn one hand I'm delighted to have a Taiwanese restaurant within walking distance of me, close enough for take out. The flavor of all the braised items reminds me of the small roadside shops I would stop by when visiting my grandparents in Tainan many years ago. The tea egg - which brought back the aromas of the typical Taiwanese seven-eleven, where these are perpetually cooking - was well-seasoned with five spices and heavy on the anise.\\n\\nI was, however, a bit disappointed with the overall level of flavoring in the vegetarian bento box I ordered, which primarily features a large chunk of tofu in lieu of meat options. All the flavors are right and there, it's just as if they need to be dialed up from a 5 to a 10. Maybe this is just a product of them scaling up their operations for this new fast casual format in Williamsburg, and I will definitely keep trying this spot regardless!\", 'The food here is amazing. Homestyle Taiwanese food. Cooked to perfection. The owner even gave my friend and I free chicken soup! I highly recommend this place in terms of the food and service.\\n\\nWhat could be improved though is the atmosphere. Other restaurants in this area have a more classy vibe, but this restaurant seems a little more sterile. The lights and decor looked more like a very brightly lit bubble tea shop, and there was no music. It was so quiet, we could hear other conversations from across the room. I would recommend this place to at least add some ambient music!', 'I really enjoyed my meal here. Really neat, beautiful decor. The service was incredible--we got the most delicious chicken soup on the house. We ordered fried dumplings, pork with rice cakes, and sweet and sour fish. All were excellent. Would highly recommend!', \"The amazing spot from Bayside just expanded to Brooklyn, bringing some much-needed Chinese food to the area. It's also the only place in the immediate vicinity to get some great Taiwanese food, including Mama Lee's famous Salt & Pepper Chicken and Pork Chops.\\n\\nDefinitely get the Lu Rou Fan and the Beef Noodle Soup too, but there's so much more that I'll definitely be back for soon.\", 'I love their beef noodles so much, really flavorfull and has big chunks of beef. Mama Lee was so nice and gave us a free cucumber salad dish to go with our order because we ordered two meat dishes, she said the cucumber salad could be a refreshing add on for our experience. The rest of the staff was really nice too, I will definitely come back', \"I was really excited about another Taiwanese spot in the area but unfortunately was a bit disappointed. Maybe we went on an off day? But I couldn't recommend anything except the bamboo shoots and the cucumber dishes. The fried pork chop, three cup chicken, and beef noodle soup were all very one-note and mostly just salty. I would've liked to have tasted less oiliness from the pork chop, more five spice flavor from the chicken, and bouncier vs. overcooked noodles in the beef soup. I did enjoy the fried scallions and chilies, but when we went there was also no hot sauce which would've elevated all of the dishes. \\n\\nThe service and ambience were great! The space is very modern yet cozy, the perfect atmosphere for a late lunch.\", \"I tried numerous Taiwanese restaurants in the city and this one is by far the highest quality to price ratio. If you want authentic homey food in a clean, quiet, and calm ambiance this is the place to go. Their homemade chili oil goes well with everything. I love the chicken soup which I get every time I go, but also look forward to trying some of their rotating recipes. It's fast casual so you order and pay first before seating yourself on one of two floors.\", 'Does Taiwanese food right. Mama Lee run by a super sweet grandma. The flavors on point and she even brought out vegetables because we were eating too much meat. Haha exactly how my grandma would yell at me for not eating some fiber.', \"Authentic Taiwanese food with great service and great ambiance!\\nWe got the the Lou Rou Fan, Three Cup Chicken and Egg and Tomato.\\nReminds me of my mom's home cooking.\\nFive stars!!!\", \"I've been here a few times, and the food is always good. It leans a bit on the expensive side, but I imagine their rent is not cheap. Anyway, I went last weekend for a friend and we shared the fried dumplings, which I think are exceptionally good, and the rice cakes with pork and pickled veggies, which are also delicious. The women waiting our table (Mama Lee, perhaps?) was very sweet and attentive. Toward the end of our meal she brought us a big chicken soup on the house. I recognized it as a pretty traditional soup that my Taiwanese m.i.l. often makes. Everything at this restaurant is true home cooking.\", \"I saw this restaurant in one of early runs. Bookmarked and pinned it. The design and decor are minimalist which I love! The owner, Mama Lee, greets, takes and serves most of the customers. Such a lovely woman!\\n\\nWe were served a clear ( the clearest ) chicken soup, on the house. It was similar to a soup that I grew up having in the Philippines. The next dish we had was La Rou Fan. It was a bowl filled of yummy goodness ( sliced pork bits ) ! They even served extra plate of the veggies, no charge. The sweet and and sour fish and bamboo Chinese celery shredded pork was delish but not that special. \\nOver all, this place is worth trying. Oh by the way, this is a Taiwanese place. Don't associate  the name and mistake it for another Asian country\", \"Walking into Mama Lee I wasn't 100% sure what to expect! My only exposure to Taiwanese food up until this point was in the form of Taiwanese popcorn chicken and boba tea cafes. \\n\\nWhen you first walk in, you're greeted by a fairly neutral, unassuming space. Walk up the stairs and everything opens up to reveal a beautiful minimalist open dining space that despite its minimalism felt homey and comfortable. \\n\\nOur server gave us a really rich overview of the history of Mama Lee (original location in Bayside Queens - there's a NYT article on it!) and the intention of mama's food (Mei Lee) to help showcase elevated Taiwanese food that still reminds you of the meals your Taiwanese family may have made back home. He was incredibly personable,  entertaining, and informative. He was intentional with every table he spoke with and genuinely wanted everyone's feedback on their experience, what they could do better (if anything) and just, overall added to such an unforgettable experience.\\n\\nWhile I'm not Taiwanese, the taste of the food did indeed make me feel like I was back home, emphasized even further by the kindness, in a no nonsense sort of way, of Mama Lee herself. She provided extra food for me and my husband, making sure I was able to have nutritious additions for my growing baby :). It reminded me of when I go back home to visit my mom, who shows her love through her cooking - feeding me and my sisters, all the brother-in-laws, until we are on the floor laying down in a food coma. The seaweed soup Mama Lee brought us was reminiscent of a traditional Korean seaweed soup called miyeok guk (미역국) that many Koreans encourage pregnant women to eat during and after pregnancy due to its high nutritional content. I learned that Mama Lee actually grew up in Korea, so I could see where there may be influence there and that made me even more teary eyed (I don't even think I can blame pregnancy hormones on that). \\n\\nWe tried a number of different items, including the pan fried dumplings, egg fried rice, chicken salad, seaweed soup, and eggplant chicken. You also are served hot tea on the house which was really refreshing on a chilly evening.\\n\\nIt's really hard to choose favorites because everything was fantastic, but if I must, I'd say the eggplant chicken and seaweed soup were my favorites. The chicken salad was also realllyyy good and so light and refreshing. \\n\\nEggplant chicken, despite the sauce on top, maintained the nice fry of the eggplant and chicken, never getting soggy. The sauce is slightly sweet and tangy, but not too sweet, which is my preference. The beef in the seaweed soup (which, may or may not be oxtail? The beef reminded me of an oxtail soup I love from Korea) fell off the bone and was so, so tender. I ate the soup like a maniac...it was gone almost immediately after hitting the table  \\n\\nWe asked to box just a small amount of the rice leftover (we ate everything else clean...) and Mama Lee added extra items to the to-go box with items to help aid a nutritious pregnancy. She even said if I'm not feeling well, to come back and she'll make a traditional chicken soup. Both my husband and I teared up - again!! You can tell that this is just who she is - I don't think she cares for the likes, exposure, etc. I feel like she just is to doing what many Asian parents do for their children. Show their love through food and selfless generosity, so that when you walk through her doors, for at least an hour or two, you're reminded of what home should feel like.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back. Sorry, Mama Lee, to create more work for you, but it was all too good to not come back and spread the word.\", \"Mama Lee's Taiwanese haven beckons with promises of familial warmth and tantalizing flavors. I kicked off my culinary adventure with the Shacha Beef, a symphony of tenderized beef and vibrant vegetables. At $25, it dances on the edge of overpriced, but in this culinary enclave, it's par for the course.\\n\\nThe rice bowl, priced at a princely $3, raised an eyebrow until I met its companion--a perfectly cooked egg. Yet, what truly justifies the lofty prices is the accompanying hot soup, generously ladled and brimming with comfort. Mama Lee herself, an embodiment of hospitality, graced my table, evoking the feeling of a cherished dinner at grandma's house.\\n\\nMama Lee's generosity flowed like her soup, offering refills without hesitation. When I requested a takeout container, she went above and beyond, filling it with an extra helping of soup. The Shacha Beef, though a tad overpriced, delivered a satisfying, home-cooked embrace.\\n\\nWhile my server's performance left me unimpressed--he seemed a bit absent--Mama Lee emerged as the star, turning a dining experience into a memorable family affair. In the grand tapestry of Williamsburg's culinary scene, Mama Lee's stands out not just for its flavors but for the genuine touch of a Taiwanese grandmother, making it a place worth revisiting.\", \"Can't go with a full 5 stars because it has been a little inconsistent, like there seem to be some changes to some dishes, and the menu doesn't have clear descriptions, so it can be hard to tell what you are going to get, but our last order was outstanding and I will try it again soon.\\n\\nWe got the Lu Ru Fan, which I have now had 3 times, and this one was the best by far.  There are a lot of components and some strong flavors, so it might be hard to get everything right and balanced; we'll see on future orders, but I'm going to get it all the time if it is as good as it was last night.  Also, it was a lot of food for $13, and since it included rice, it was a complete meal.\\n\\nMy wife and I love rice cakes with preserved or pickled vegetables and get that at a lot of places.  This was our first try at Mama Lee, and they were about as good as I have ever had.  Looking forward to ordering them again too.  Also this was a good value compared to some of their other menu items...as some people have pointed out here, there are some expensive dishes, in particular, I don't understand why the vegetables cos as much as the meat dishes, which also have more components.\", \"One of the better service experiences I've ever had. Hospitable and generous. Our son was treated so well\", 'Food was amazing. Mama Lee is amazing. I wish this place was closer I would come all the time', \"Just the most heartwarming experience ever.. really feels like you're being taken cared of by your mom in her kitchen. We ordered beef noodle soup, eggplant chicken dish, bamboo celery and shredded pork... it was so delicious and reminded me of home. Thank you!\", 'Food was absolutely phenomenal!! The beef noodle soup made us all feel so warm on the inside! We also got the lo rau fan bento box and it had dumplings and side dishes. Great variety. Mama Lee would check us up on and made sure we had enough broth, noodles, and rice for our order. The restaurant has such a homey feel to it as well. Overall, an amazing experience.', \"I wish I could give this establishment a higher rating, since I am always delighted to see a new Taiwanese restaurant open. But 3.5 feels fair. \\n\\nGiven the small likelihood we would trek to Bayside to visit the original Mama Lee, we decided to dine at this new Williamsburg location, which had opened seven weeks prior. We ordered the sanbeiji (three cups chicken) and the zhajiangmian. The sanbeiji, a signature dish in Taiwanese cuisine, was amazing and the best I'd ever had. The meat was perfectly crispy on the outside, yet tender inside. The sauce was also unusually spot-on--perfectly sweet and savory, and not too oily. However, the zhajiangmian was probably the worst I'd ever had at a restaurant. The ground pork and noodles were shockingly bland, as if the chef had drunkenly forgotten to add some key ingredients to enhance the flavor. This was a huge disappointment. \\n\\nThe food is somewhat expensive for practically a fast-casual restaurant. We ordered at the front, and food was served quickly. I did appreciate the well-lit, clean, and minimalist ambience, as well as the Taiwan-related posters on the wall. I also appreciated that there were three high chairs available, comfortably accommodating my two children. Service was friendly. I was dubious about dining at the restaurant so soon after it had opened; hopefully the cooking will be more consistent and the menu will expand to include other favorites at the Bayside Mama Lee location.\", 'The food is so delicious with flavoring. Great taiwanese food. Good customer service and the food is brought out in a good amount of time. The place is clean.', \"Great food and kind staff.

It is an interestingly decorated Vietnamese restaurant. It had a ton of balloon shaped lights hanging from the roof. It gave very romantic vibes.  We immediately got seated. \\n\\nWe started with the short rib massaman curry. I really didn't think the sauce was as great as I wanted it to be. The short rib was on a bone and tasted great; however, the sauce didn't add to the dish. The only saving grace on this dish was how there was a lump of roasted mash sweet potato. It really added a nice sweet to the dish.\\n\\nWe also shared some shrimp dumplings. These dumplings are worth getting. They were so juicy and delicious. The dumplings were served with chili soy sauce.\\n\\nFor our main dish, we got Obao Bun Platter. We were expecting it to be bao bun type of dish. Instead it was lettuce on a plate that had a variety of ingredients to put in it. I guess we both should have more carefully read the menu.\", \"I met a friend here for dinner before a show.

It's not the most authentic pho I've ever had, but it was very good and hit the spot with the cold weather outside. \\n\\nWe decided to split both desserts, and I loved the sticky rice from the mango sticky rice. The mangos were perfectly ripe and super sweet. \\n\\nService was great too.

My friend and I shared the wings. They were seasoned well and friend crispy. Neither of us were fans of the dipping sauce. \\n\\nFor my entree I had the Pho Bo (beef pho). What I can say is this is one of the very few restaurants I've patronized where it did not take doctoring to get the broth to the flavor profile I like. With a bit of Sriracha their broth is by far a 10/10.

Perfectly cooked noodles with rich, savory flavors that hit all the right notes.\\n\\nFinished meal with mango sticky. \\n\\nBy the time we left the restaurant , the place was packed--tables full and a nice-sized bar buzzing.

The ambiance is dark, classy yet casual, and pretty loud. Both cocktails were good but honestly didn't stand out to me much. I enjoyed the flavors (although very sweet) but could've easily gone without them. I enjoyed the Vietnamese Chicken Wings; they were crispy, juicy, and hot. Great appetizer to share! Both the Udon Basil Noodles and Spicy Lemongrass Kalbi Short Ribs were delicious. The udon was fresh, soft, and went well with the shrimp.

We understand how busy service can be, but after this we feel very \"meh\" about going back. \\n\\nAs for the food - the pho is definitely good, but to be totally honest it didn\\'t have some special spark that set it far apart from other NY places. The platter was a 9/10 on the taste, but for $21 we believe you can find better elsewhere. The tacos stood out for being relatively bad - the taco shell fell apart so it ends up being more like a mushroom - corn chip - salad. I\\'m normally a big fan of mushrooms but was not into the flavor either. The papaya salad was solid, a little small for the $12 price but overall worth it. \\n\\nAnyway, thanks for reading!

The cocktails were good (I got the one Thousand and One Nights) and they had a lunch happy hour so they were $13 instead of $18.\\n\\nThe Khao Soi with Beef Short Rib was a little pricey at $32 but it was massive and was enough for two meals, so honestly pretty good value.\\n\\nThe service was quite good as well and the restaurant interior was well decorated and roomy. Would definitely recommend for a large party event.', \"Nicely crisped pork belly, with fresh lettuce and pickled vegetables to make a delicious wrap. A great snack to grab at the bar or when you have a smaller appetite. I also got to try a bit of khao soi which was very pickled vegetable and coconut cream forward. One of the heaviest khao sois I've had and I think I would have liked to see it more balanced in terms of flavors and texture. I also got a taste of the pho bo which I thought was very mid but adequate as hot soup on a cold rainy day.\\nWe sat at the bar as all other seating had already been booked out for the evening.

The server came to us with water and we got the Thai tea, beef rib pho, and pad see ew. \\n\\nThe pho was flavorful and honestly, very filling. The beef rib was very tender and fell off the bone. I didn't add any hoisom sauce to my pho because it had flavor already. \\n\\nThe pad see ew was probably my favorite though.

It wasn't too busy when we got there, so we were able to get a table for five pretty easily and were seated right away. The inside of the restaurant has a nice ambience with cool lights from the ceiling, so this seems like a pretty good place for a date night for example.\\n\\n I decided to try out the Pad Thai and the Crab Fried Rice, as these usually are dishes that are solid at most Thai places. These weren't too spicy and the flavors were pretty solid, although they were a bit pricey (maybe not by NY standards though lol). The portion sizes were pretty decent at least, and while it was not too far off from other thai food I've had it was still a good meal and I enjoyed going there. I also tried their mojito for a drink, which was quite aesthetic and pretty refreshing to have.\\n\\n Overall, this is a cool Thai place to check out if you're around the area and for groups of people to go to.\", \"I got the kimchee fries ($10) and crab fried rice ($25).

But was still good!\\n\\nSat at the bar, nicely decorated. Nice server!\", \"Went to Obao for the first time to try their menu for restaurant week. Amazing price for three course meal. The presentation, taste and ambiance was definitely worth every penny. Our waitress was so friendly and checked in on us constantly. My friend and I don't drink alcohol so she recommended some mock tails and made us a delicious mojito. My personal favorite was the appetizer (Tom Rang Muoi) which was a sweet and savory shrimp coated with a crunchy top and a tangy sauce.\\nNOT PICTURED: the three course meal does come with dessert, we got mango sticky rice and durian. Was not a big fan of the durian dessert.\", 'Very wonderful food and service! We got dinner here before a show and enjoyed it immensely. The music was a little odd (early 2000s pop) as it was very different from the ambiance of the restaurant (classy beautiful). Highly recommend the food and cocktails', \"After seeing this place on Tiktok, I really wanted to try. As a Vietnamese person myself, I haven't had much Vietnamese fusion, nonetheless Viet-Thai, and all I can say was that I was blown away. My boyfriend and I arrived right at the start of dinner time, so it was pretty empty. The inside of the restaurant was so beautiful and romantic--dim lighting with lots of SE Asian decor--and the staff was so kind.\\n\\nWe ordered a Tom Yum soup, oysters, spicy lemongrass kalbi, and the bo luc lac. Everything was phenomenal. The tom yum was so flavorful, yet light and had tons of shrimp and mushroom in it. The oysters were very fresh and although a bit bigger than I would like, still delicious. And both entrees were soso delicious. The meat was juicy, tender, and the marinade was heavenly. Would definitely recommend and come back again.\", 'Food was excellent. Had the drunken noodles. Portions are filling, the ambiance is great and the service is professional.', 'Came here upon recommendation from my friend & the interior was super dark with colorful Thai accents. Loved the sleek and traditional look.  We all shared the Pla Todd, Roasted Duck Noodles, and the Crab fried rice. \\nThe pla todd was a crispy, flavorful fish and the crab fried rice had the juiciest crab meat. I wish the rice had more texture but it was still delicious. And I really enjoyed the roasted duck noodles but some of the duck pieces were a tad dry. Would still order again.\\n We also shared the Fresh Shrimp Summer roll as an appetizer and it came in two huge pieces.\\nWe loved the two drinks we got: Lod Chong & Comrade party. Lod Chong had a sweet creamy (slightly strong) aftertaste and the Comrade Party had the tastiest rim and flavor.

The atmosphere is very nice. Bar seating is fun and lively.', \"Restaurant Week NYC: OBAO\\n\\nMy friend recommended the fusion Thai and Vietnamese food here. I came by the restaurant during lunch time before I headed to the MOMA. The interior was beautiful and the service was great. I chose their 2 course lunch special for (30). I got the Pla Salmon: sous vide salmon, shallot, mint, bird's eye chili, lemongrass, culantro, fish sauce for my appetizer and the Cháo Canh: round rice noodles, pork ribs, grounded pork, pork blood cake, pork sausage, fried shallots, scallion, and cilantro in slow cooked pork broth. I regret my choice with the appetizer because it was an extremely small dish, the fish was probably the size of my middle finger, and was finished in less than a bite; however, the main course was great. Since everything was slow cooked, all the meats slid off the bone and were super soft. As much as I did enjoy their entree, I don't think I'd be back for another restaurant week special because of the choices of appetizers. \\n\\nSmallest appetizer I've ever had!\", 'I thought the food was fantastic here! The restaurant is beautiful and the service was excellent (our waiter was Pete).

She had mentioned that Happy Hour is going on right now and they could seat 8 of us right away!\\n\\nObao offers HH up until 6pm and we had just under an hour to be seated and enjoy good food and good drinks. All of us were starving and the company was just right for a few drinks!\\n\\nWhen we all arrived, the female server had menus for all of us and quickly started taking drink orders.  Surprisingly all drinks came out at the same time, nice and refreshing that it hit the spot. \\n\\nI was very impressed with presentation and how fast all of our food is delivered, almost as close to how pictures were on the menu. \\n\\nOnce we were done, I needed to rinse off my sticky fingers. Restrooms were on the same floor upstairs.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back again, perhaps come back earlier for HH or a night cap next time. It's super convenient to the hotel which only takes less than 15 minutes by foot.

The Flunk Flink was a sweet tropical drink flavored with lychee and coconut. \\n\\nThe Pad Thai was highly recommended by the bartender. It was delicious, so I'm glad I paid attention to him.  It was one of the best Thai dishes I'd ever had.  It had savory shrimps, a perfectly cooked poached egg, and crunchy peanuts.

It was not overcrowded and they had quick service. They did have Happy Hour on the drinks during the time (I think it was $13 for the cocktails). I recommend the Bruiseberry Mojito. It has fruity flavors and was not overpowering. I also really liked the Sambal Spiced Calamari. It was really flavorful and seasoned well. The pieces were crispy and cooked perfectly. From the restaurant week menu, I ordered bua loy (rice balls in coconut milk) for dessert, salt & Pepper tiger prawn shrimp for the appetizer, and another dish that was served in a coconut (I forgot the name of it). I liked the shrimp. They give you two large pieces. For the dessert, the coconut milk was really sweet and the rice balls were not as flavorful so I was not the biggest fan.']}, {'id': '5CuYWr0-cE01HxlBu5Ka6g', 'name': 'Carne Mare', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VfiEm7YTS9cRuzaZnRk_0Q/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://www.carnemare.com', 'display_address': '89 South St', 'display_phone': '(212) 280-4600', 'rating': 4.4, 'reviews': [\"Literally the best restaurant in the world, not exaggerating!

They even had a few spirit-free cocktails which were also great.\\n\\nThe food good, but didn't blow me away. The meal started with complimentary bread, which was so flavorful and light and fluffy! We started with the $16 mozzarella with caviar appetizer - tasty but overrated. It tasted like both individual ingredients put together, and not like something new or unique. For entrees, we had the ribeye and the filet mignon with sides of creamed spinach and rustic potatoes. Everything was good except the filet which was tougher than I'm used to and kind of dry. The steaks came with a couple of different sauces, which saved the filet, but for the prices they charge, it shouldn't need it.

Mozz & caviar, lobster pasta, duck. If you're in the area, worth a stop.\\n\\nVery random weeknight dinner with some colleagues. Popped in and tried a bit of everything. Apps-wise, got the spicy crab lettuce cups, mozz & caviar. The crab cups were good but kinda tasted like a spicier crab cocktail although maybe that's the idea. The mozzarella and caviar is expensive at $16 each but it's very well done. That crispy coating, the cheese is sweet, stretchy and that briney cavier complements it well.\\n\\nLobster pasta, spicy, very tasty but probably would get one per two people if sharing. Veal chop milanese was good but kinda what you'd expect. It's cooked wel but yeah, fried chop. The duck was very tasty, well-seasoned, not gamey and quite luscious with that sauce. The creamed spinach and the roasted potatoes went perfect.\\n\\nOverall, would stop in again with the wife one day and come back to try some other things.\", \"After many, many times of passing by Carne Mare at the Seaport, we finally came here with family for my partners birthday. It's on the pricier side and is definitely an upscale spot, yet feels like a modern take of old school Italian vibes inside; chic and well designed. \\n\\nAs someone who doesn't go to traditional Italian spots often, the food was unexpectedly very good. Really delicious steak, amazing tableside farmer's salad (though I could do without the table side making of the salad itself... Just feels a little gimmicky and awkward lol), and awesome pastas. Another unexpected choice I wouldn't normally go for was the twice baked potato. Perfect amount of black truffle so that it wasn't overpowering, and perfectly creamy potato.\\n\\nService was very attentive. Lots of waiters and servers constantly filling water, checking in, etc. \\n\\nI would come back for the food in a heartbeat, or even for cocktails and oysters at the downstairs bar which seems like a great vibe. This is a great addition to the Seaport and I get the hype now, and why it's always so crowded when there's outdoor seating during the summer!\", 'Lovely atmosphere and delicious food. Service was attentive. Might choose to sit on second floor next time.', \"4.5 stars rounding up to 5 bc of the amazing service and ambiance. \\n\\nFor food, we enjoyed the Caesar salad, red crab corn agnolotti (it was seasonal), the prime rib (limited quantity per night warning), and the broccolini. Although good, I didn't think much of the mozzarella sticks with caviar ($16/stick!), the roasted bone marrow (should've come with a bread), or the 17-layer chocolate cake.\\n\\nFor drinks, I got the granita cocktail given the rave reviews but didn't love it. While it was somewhat refreshing, I didn't love the massive chunks of ice which left very little drink. \\n\\nWe sat outdoors and loved the ambiance. Beautiful views of it doors and the indoor dining area was nice as well (request a table by the window on the second floor). My one critique is that I didn't love the music. \\n\\nThe service was amazing - everyone was super friendly and attentive. I also liked how easy it was to get a same-day reservation and that they didn't give us a hard time for being 15 min late (was running late from work plus subway delays). \\n\\nWill definitely return!\", 'I took my fiancé for her birthday to Carne Mare and this was a great choice.  Service, food, knowledge, drinks, and wine were all impeccable.  The resident somm was great and attentive to our needs and questions.  The food presentation was spot on.  Also,  great location at Pier 17.  Great choice for an upscale date night or birthday.', \"Can't rave about Carne Mare enough! \\n\\nHosted my graduation dinner here and it exceeded my expectations. Everything was perfect from the service to the food to the amazing views of the city! \\n\\nWould definitely recommend!\", 'We visited for a birthday celebration, and the staff really went above and beyond to make the occasion memorable. The space strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort, with a sweeping Seaport view through the windows that add a coastal charm. The service was sweet and considerate, which made the meal feel even more special.\\n\\nThe food was equally satisfying - from appetizers like the beef tartare to main courses like the prime ribeye and French toast, every dish delivered on both flavor and presentation.', 'Came here a week ago with a few friends before their wedding the next day. We sat inside on the lower level we still had a nice view of the seaport. The food was absolutely fabulous. We all ordered the mozzarella sticks with caviar which as the staff will tell you is an experience. And I will tell you they are right.  Just know the cost is per stick lol I got the boneless prime rib as my main and it was perfect. My friends and I had a great time conversing with each other and the staff. Nate and the rest of the team were so awesome to us that gave the happy couple a complimentary dessert which was a great surprise. Carne Mare is one of my favorite go to places for a nice meal with friends, a date or solo.', 'Service \\nAmbiance \\nFood \\nPorterhouse steak can be had better elsewhere however sides and wine selection saved the evening.', \"We sat outside this time and the view is just perfect! Ordered Caviar mozzarella sticks to start the appetites with a really delicious salad! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! \\nOh and the bread is very fluffy.\\nService was great you will feel like you're in great hands.\", 'Carne Mare is a fantastic spot and I would definitely be back albeit I don\\'t frequent downtown Manhattan that often.  Everything that my friends and I ordered was fantastic (with the sole exception of the brussel sprouts which was too sweet for our liking).  The drinks also could\\'ve been better but again, the pros outweigh the cons here. \\n\\nOne of my girlfriends and I ordered the \"Carne Mare King Cut\" to share which is honestly a steal at $72.  Cooked to a perfect medium, make sure to get it with sides such as the mushroom marsala (the standout) and potatoes rustica.  Their complimentary bread is also very good- definitely use the sauce the steak comes in as a dipping sauce. To end the meal, the chocolate cake was necessary despite very generous portions of everything.  It was very moist and shareable among us 3.  The server was very attentive and kind as well.  All in all, Carne Mare is 100% worthy of a try in my book.', '\"A Perfect Birthday Celebration Spot - Carne Mare at Pier 17!\"\\n\\nI celebrated my birthday at Carne Mare, and it was an unforgettable experience! From the moment you walk in, the ambiance and design of the place are absolutely stunning. The décor is inspired by a ship, with elegant nautical touches that give the restaurant a classy yet cozy feel. It\\'s definitely a feast for the eyes--ideal for anyone who loves a well-thought-out, aesthetically pleasing space.\\n\\nService: The staff here truly knows how to make you feel special. Not only are they attentive and professional, but they also go out of their way to help with taking photos! They knew exactly how to capture the best angles, which was a huge plus for me. It\\'s those little touches that made the night extra memorable.\\n\\nFood: As for the food, it was phenomenal. We ordered a variety of steaks and chops, and each one was cooked to perfection. The highlight for me was the mozzarella stick with caviar--an absolute must-try! The combination was indulgent and unique, with the salty caviar pairing perfectly with the rich, creamy mozzarella. The salads were fresh and balanced, complementing the richness of the main courses.\\n\\nPrice: Keep in mind that the prices here are on the expensive side, but considering the quality of the food and the overall experience, it feels justifiable for a special occasion.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The whole place is cozy yet upscale, with a warm, welcoming vibe. It\\'s not just a great place to eat but also to soak in the aesthetic. If you\\'re into beautiful, Instagram-worthy spots, Carne Mare won\\'t disappoint. I took a ton of pictures, and every shot came out looking amazing! Even the bathroom had perfect lighting and a stylish mirror, making it another great spot for photos.\\n\\nLocation: Carne Mare is located at Pier 17, and when you step outside, you\\'re greeted with breathtaking views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the FiDi skyscrapers. It\\'s the perfect spot to take a stroll after dinner and soak in the city skyline. The scenery adds another level of charm, making it not just a dinner, but an experience.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re celebrating a special occasion like a birthday (as I did) or looking for a romantic date night spot, I\\'d highly recommend Carne Mare. The combination of excellent food, attentive service, and picturesque location makes it a place you\\'ll want to return to again and again.\\n\\nPro tip: Don\\'t forget to take some photos outside by the pier--the views are just as amazing as the food!', \"This is a nice place with a nice brunch, albeit pricey. \\n\\nTwo small complaints - still had a good time, but I figure I'll mention them regardless because details matter folks! \\n\\nFirst, the steak that came with the steak and eggs had way too much salt thrown on it, and it definitely wasn't medium rare as ordered. Even calling it medium would've been a stretch. It was still good, but properly cooked steak at a chophouse seems like the bare minimum, even at lunch time. \\n\\nSecond - our waitress didn't know the correct pour for a glass of wine, but luckily a manager was nearby and came over to correct it, which was much appreciated. \\n\\nOverall we had a decent time, the prix fixe menu ($55) comes with quite a bit of food. The Panna cotta and Caesar salad were fab\", 'Came here while in town for my birthday. My friend told them that it was my birthday and they had my name printed on our menus! The Prosecco was flowing. The server that has been there the longest is the absolute best and most knowledgeable. He made the experience extra perfect. The food was amazing as well. The shrimp cocktail, the lobster pasta, caviar, lamb chops. Everything I tried was so flavorful. I will definitely go back when in town. All of the staff from the hostesses, managers, bartender Liz were so nice and helpful in suggestions', 'Service was great. Had a table with a view of the water Eddie our waiter was excellent. The Caesar salad was crispy and delicious. The octopus carpaccio also was very good and the Bronzino was tasty. The highlight was the rigatoni Bolognese very delicious.', \"Wow! Where do I begin with this restaurant?\\n\\nWe made reservations in advance for a birthday dinner for 4 people. From the moment we walked in, the place is beautifully decorated for the holidays. The hostesses took all our coats. We were seating in a nice booth in the corner on the first floor. \\n\\nOur server was very animated but knowledgeable of all the items on the menu. He was a top-class server. I wish I remembered his name, but he made the night very enjoyable. We all had their filet mignons and it was cooked perfectly. Super tender, like cutting butter almost. VERY delicious. We opted for the truffle twice baked potato, and it was out of the world delicious. I've never had one of these before and this took potatoes to a whole new level. Our server recommended us taking the truffle sauce and putting it on our steaks - great idea! It came with some broccolini too which was also very tasty. \\n\\nThey brought out some ice cream desserts for the birthday girl at the end which was a nice touch. Everything about our dinner at Carne Mare was enjoyable from the food to the service. Prices were high, but worth it. Would definitely be back if in the area!\", \"Stepping into this upscale steakhouse felt like a treat from the start, and the experience only got better. The service was impeccable--our waiter was warm, attentive, and genuinely wonderful, as was the entire staff. It set the tone for a meal that was nothing short of memorable.  \\n\\nThe steak was a standout, cooked to perfection with a seared crust and juicy, flavorful center. Each bite was exactly what you'd hope for in a top-tier steakhouse. Alongside it, the sides and starters shined just as brightly. The bread? Easily some of the best I've ever had--warm, soft, and so good I almost asked for seconds. The wedge salad was crisp, fresh, and had just the right balance of toppings to make it both satisfying and refreshing.  \\n\\nAnd let me talk about the twice-baked potato! Creamy, cheesy, and packed with flavor, it was the perfect indulgence. But the meal wasn't complete without dessert, and we made sure to try two. The 17-layer chocolate cake was decadent and rich, a chocolate lover's dream. The rhubarb strawberry crisp, on the other hand, was a delightful contrast--sweet, tangy, and the perfect ending to an already stellar meal.  \\n\\nAfterward, we left the restaurant with happy hearts and full bellies, ready for our walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. This spot is a must-try.\", 'I hate to write this because I used to praise & recommend this restaurant to friends, family, colleagues and clients. We came here for a birthday dinner last night and the service was absolutely horrible. They never checked in on our table, we had to ask for more water or flag down someone for a drink order. We ordered $100 bottle of wine that we had to pour ourselves all night. The restaurant was pretty empty and they still never came by our table. It was so odd. The only time they checked was when our wine bottle was finished and asked if we wanted another one. Our bill was over $700. Highly disappointed. Food was great as usual but overall experience of the service was disappointing.', \"I came here for dessert and drinks with my girlfriend on a Thursday night. We had 9:30pm reservations and even at that hour the place was busy. The restaurant was very nice and service was excellent. We came here specifically for the 17 layer chocolate cake ($18). It was delicious and not too sweet which was a nice surprise. I ordered the Sazerac which was good but I don't think it was worth $27. My girlfriend got a glass of wine for $25. For two people getting dessert and 1 drink each, the night cost $90! (Including tax and tip) For a special occasion this place was nice and everyone there was kind and accommodating. The bathrooms also have hand motion sensors that open the door for you both on the inside and outside so you don't have to touch the handle which I thought was a nice. \\n\\nIf you get seated on the second floor you will have a great view of the water.\", \"Our family's annual Thanksgiving celebration in NYC was made truly special by our dinner at Carne Mare. With 15 of us in attendance, the upstairs private dining room was the perfect setting for both a delicious meal and engaging conversation. The oval table allowed everyone to see each other, fostering lively cross-table discussions, and the virtual fireplace on the television added a cozy touch.\\n\\nThe food, drinks, and--most notably--the service were all outstanding. Our lead server, Juana, was warm, professional, and attentive. She and her team ensured our glasses were always filled, plates were cleared and reset between courses, and that we had everything we needed. Victor, the manager on duty, also checked in to make sure everything was to our liking, further enhancing the experience.\\n\\nAs for the food and drinks, we had preselected several menu items, and every single dish exceeded expectations. The grilled oysters, spicy crab lettuce cups, mozzarella sticks with caviar, and garlic rolls were all bursting with flavor and perfectly portioned. The Sicilian Caesar salad was exceptional--definitely a highlight. For entrees, we savored the Tomahawk steak and Seabass, complemented by rustic potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. The Tomahawk came with two delicious sauces, and everything was cooked to perfection, balanced with just the right flavors. For dessert, the panna cotta and 17-layer chocolate cake were the perfect sweet ending. Our sommelier expertly paired a Chardonnay and Cabernet that elevated the entire meal.\\n\\nFrom start to finish, our experience at Carne Mare was nothing short of exceptional. They've set a high bar, and we're already looking forward to our next visit--as well as exploring other restaurants in their impressive portfolio.\", \"I'm a big AC fan and was excited to finally try Carne Mare (there's also one in Nashville which I will also have to check out ).

They also have a full dining room upstairs, similar to the layout of Bar Primi.\\n\\nCan't wait to return!!\", \"Excellent service and great ambiance. Loved the grilled oysters. The raw oysters were good and fresh. I'm not sure how they prepared their meat, im assuming reverse sear on some, maybe Sous vide, but the lamp chop was delicious! Rib eye was well cooked. I'm just disappointed in the prime rib, I was not a fan of the sauce that it came with. It was a little sweet, I'm guess a balsamic reduction with the jus? But overall definitely a good spot to go.\", \"Carne Mare is a pretty good steakhouse where the atmosphere is cozy and classy, the servers are warm and hospitable and the food... pretty delicious. \\n\\nBread is amazing. I'll just leave it at that. \\n\\nThe octopus app was interesting. Sliced very thin. \\n\\nThe oysters were delicious. \\n\\nThe Caesar salad was what you'd expect. \\n\\nThe aged steaks were good but wasn't the best when compared to other powerhouses. This included both the tomahawk and the porthouse. \\n\\nThe sides were great. Potatoes, corn and mushrooms. \\n\\nThe dessert consisted of 16 layer chocolate cake and the spumoni. The latter wasn't very good at all.\", \"Food - carne = meat.  This place serves up good temperatured steaks just as you would want it.  I ordered the boneless ribeye and it was done proper and not dry at all and was so delish!  We also ordered the tuna tartare and some sides like polenta, sweet corn and mushrooms.\\n\\nService - attentive, concerned, and overall great service experience that I would not hesitate to come back here again and again!\\n\\nAmbiance - very nice and well kept.  Twas classy and just well appointed.\\n\\nVerdict - it was a great experience with the management and staff as very accommodating and always checking to make sure we were all ok.  There wasn't a time we felt neglected.  And to put on top of this, the location and the food was great.   No complaints at all!  If i had to be nitpicking, it would be the price, but we came here knowing that so doesn't count!\", 'I went here for a birthday brunch - unfortunately the upstairs area was closed on Sunday but the outside seating area and main floor were open with plenty of seats.

I had a very lovely lunch here.  the restaurant is beautiful, the view outside of the seaport is beautiful.  the food was very good, but i\\'m giving four stars because it wasn\\'t \"wow\".  that said, it is a solid spot and i\\'d definitely return.', \"Man the seaport is different nowadays. I remember it being a rundown little strip, however now it's more upscale and catering better to tourists.  Was skeptical regardless when a business partner wanted to meet up here, however they've really done a beautiful job renovating.  Carne e Mare is halfway down the pier and is a mix of outside dining downstairs with a proper dining room upstairs.  The menu and space fit the bill of an upscale restaurant, however the service was just ok.  They were very frantic in seating us initially, even forgetting menus, which was weird as the restaurant was mostly empty.  Whatever, new places sometimes.\\n\\nI got a herbal whiskey cocktail that I was skeptical of but which turned out to be both good and interesting.  For appetizers we got the calamari, burrata with pesto, and oysters.  I love it when something extra is fried up with the calamari, in this case peppers.  Otherwise this was well done calamari, tentacles and all.  The burrata was typical however the pesto addition was very nice.  Had to ask what oysters we got as the servers initially weren't sure (obviously east coast), however they were great regardless.\\n\\nI got the Rigatoni with dry aged bolognese.  It drives me crazy when places waste good cuts of beef on bolognese, where they're just ground up and they lose the integrity of the meat.  That said, if it inspires the kitchen to pay attention and make a proper bolognese like they do here, then it's worth it.  The sauce was rich, flavorful and packed with meat.  Pasta was good quality.  Not sure why they felt the need to add Parmesan foam versus just regular ass cheese, however this was a minor complaint.\\n\\nGlad to have this place in walking distance of the office.  Will be back!\", \"All the items on the menu are great, pretty sure I've tried every dish over the handful of times we've been here.  Their prices have gone up post pandemic, so it's a little on the pricey side, but if you are looking for a nice high end meal, this is in my opinion, the best restaurant in the block of seaport restaurants.\\n\\nIf you really want to splurge, the Gorgonzola Wagyu strip is a treat.  It's a small steak for the price, but once you have a bite, you won't feel as bad about the pricing.  It's a truly unique bite of meat, with its salty and buttery flavor profile and tenderness.\\n\\nIf I had to knock them for anything, I might bring it down a half star for the price, but there are pricier restaurants in the area that are not nearly as good.\", \"Absolutely amazing dinner- I was taking a chance booking this for a group of 6 on New Year's Day. 5/5 for food and ambience- we ordered octopus, yellowfin tuna and Caesar salad to start, all were so tasty. The mains also lived up to expectations: especially enjoyed the truffle agnolotti, scallops, veal chop and tomahawk steak. And for dessert, the chocolate cake was not too sweet and just right. Skip the baked spumoni, the three gelatos weren't very good. \\n\\nWould definitely go back! The wines were also great and reasonably priced. Don't forget to ask for the bread!\", \"Gorgeous Space, Amazing Food!\\n\\nI live nearby and had always walked past it, but only got to try it last week and I loved everything about this place.\\n\\nThe actual space is beautiful feeling very elegant yet cozy. The staff was amazing throughout the night from our greeting at the door to our waiters they where very friendly and attentive, constantly checking in and open to making food suggestions that where on point. \\n\\nThe food was a hit even from the start, the garlic bread is to die for! I also tried the spanish octopus, Wagyu 'Bavetta' Filet and the scallops and everything was incredible. I can't wait to try their brunch!\", \"Went for dessert and drinks for our anniversary! We sat on the second floor by the windows, as requested (I'm very grateful they were able to honor my request)! I loved the Syrah I got and my boyfriend loved his cocktail. We got their famous 17 layer chocolate cake which was delicious! Not too dense or sweet! The service was amazing and I was thankful they let us sit a while to enjoy the ambience. It was a pretty pricey night, 2 cocktails and dessert with tip was $90. I would go back if I was celebrating another special occasion. You're paying for the service and ambience for sure!\", \"This place is right on the dock near the water with some outside seating so ambiance is nice. Service was ok although we had to wait a long time for our check and for them to close it out. This place wasn't really for me as far as food goes though. My sister was happy with her yellowfin tuna. My mom just got a fruit plate and it was big, probably good for sharing at brunch. I was planning on getting the Cesar salad but they didn't offer any type of protein with it like chicken or salmon. I heard another table ask this as well. They told me I could buy another entree. Instead I opted for the broccolini and the lamb sausage. The broccolini was excellent and the lamb sausage was just ok. Needed a bit more salt/flavor for me but there were fresh herbs in it.  The presentation of it however almost made me not want to eat it. It was rolled up like a pinwheel and that's all I'll say. The casing was also a bit tough. My cocktail was also just ok. A bit watered down.\", \"It was good. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was quite nice, a posh steakhouse type of vibe, and the food was satisfactory. We ordered the grilled oysters, the wagyu steak tartare, and the crab lettuce cups to start. The steak tartare was great. Mild in flavor and let the flavor of the meat shine. The grilled oysters were also super flavorful, but maybe a touch too much breading but still tasty. I didn't get to try the lettuce cups but not a big deal. The mains came in and the fish had an interesting flavor, very different but good. We sensed some fennel in there! I believe we got the last of the prime rib and some bone marrow to accompany it. The bone marrow was already dressed which I didn't love. I like my bone marrow very simple, a touch of salt will do it for me but this had some sort of vinegar on it, thinly sliced onions, and some parsley on it, kind of overpowering. The prime rib was way more rare than we wanted but the staff was kind enough to forewarn us which we really appreciated. We ordered the prime rib medium but it came out like medium rare to rare.. it was crazy! I was able to eat it but my friend didn't care to split it with me anymore. It also came with some sort of au ju already on it which was alright tasting. It had hints of sweetness and some other warm seasoning which was alright.. but their desserts!!!! We got some sort of apple tart with fig ice cream and WOW and I'm not even a dessert girly!! Every component on its own was phenomenal and together was an absolute symphony. The lemon sorbet was also fresh, tart, and absolutely NOT to be overlooked!! Get both. I repeat, get both!\", 'There is nothing to complain about. From the food to the service and the ambiance,  everything came out beautiful. Is a place for a celebration or special date night. You have to make a reservation on the website . must request to be seated upstairs.', \"The food was incredible. We split the Gorgonzola cured steak and the wedge salad. We also had three fabulous starters. I love the caviar mozzarella sticks. Our server Michael was polite and knowledgeable and helped as navigate the menu. He was attentive without being intrusive. I can't wait to come back.\", 'Visited during restaurant week for lunch. Food, service, and ambiance exceeded my expectations. Coat check was a plus. The hostess was very sweet and walked us upstairs to our table offering us a selection of multiple tables available depending on our preference. The restaurant was not crowded so we were able to get more of an intimate experience. Staff accommodated our every need even when we asked to switch to a different table to catch a better glance of the restaurant. \\n\\nWe had the octopus carpaccio with lemon and olive oil, burrata, French toast, prime rib sandwich, and lobster pasta. All dishes were delicious with my favorites being the lobster pasta and carpaccio. Would definitely come back for dinner time and to try their cocktails since my friend and I were on a no alcohol kick (even though they have some spirit-free cocktails on the menu that we kindly deferred). Had an amazing time.', \"I was skeptical of this place given that it is a chain and located in a very touristy spot but I was blown away with how amazing the ambiance, service and food were. It had major classic Manhattan vibes. Our waiter Jed was soooo nice. Literally hyped us up for everything we ordered and honestly helped us gauge how much food was good for us and he was spot on. Loved him so much.\\nAll the food was fantastic. The oysters were super fresh and not fishy at all. The bread was AMAZING, so soft, warm, and flavorful. The steak tartare was fresh and light. The mozzarella sticks with caviar we're definitely an experience but I probably would not get them again because the mozzarella stick itself was a little greasy and overwhelming; it took away from the caviar. The wagyu Bavette was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender. It came with 2 sauces and I personally preferred their version of a bordelaise. We also got the creamed corn which perfectly complimented the savory steak. \\nI would definitely recommend for a special occasion!!\", 'The staff was incredible, making sure everything was ok and making the reservation special with some delicious ice cream as we were celebrating a birthday. The steaks were cooked to perfection (we got the limited availability king cuts) and along with all the other side dishes, we were 1,000% satisfied.', '90 minutes from sitting down and there was no sign of our entrees after drinks and apps being excessively long. Our server who was initially very nice, completely disappeared as did our orders. Another server was looking at our table with a confused face about no food on our table because other tables who came in after us (one way after us) and ordered after us were already finishing their entrees with no sign of our food - and those tables were slow to begin with let alone ours. \\n\\nAfter we flagged down a different waiter since our food and server were MIA, the manager came over and was literally the rudest staff person I\\'ve ever encountered in a restaurant (see how this is my only Yelp review of a restaurant ever). We were told if we didn\\'t like it we could just leave, and that he didn\\'t appreciate our attitude, so we did leave and were not charged for the apps and drinks we\\'d already had.\\n\\nThey obviously completely forgot our order, or something else was wrong in the kitchen - but they decided to put the blame on us instead. Somebody was having a bad time that day and decided to take it out on us apparently. By the time we left the restaurant was probably 30% full because we had been there so long.\\n\\nRead other recent reviews talking about service a few days before this one like \"Her behavior towards me was intentionally rude, malicious, and targeted.\"  This is what happened to us as well. Something toxic appears to be happening at this restaurant at the moment.\\n\\nThis place is very expensive, and the service was radically different from others we\\'ve gone to in Manhattan.\\n\\nOne note, the women at the hostess stand, were the opposite, very helpful and kind! Exactly the service you would expect at a place this expensive, too bad the rest of it was so awful.', \"The food alone deserves 5 stars! We were blown away by everything we had. \\n\\nThe complimentary pull-apart garlic bread was worth every calorie. Do not skip. I repeat. Do not skip!!! We shared the Spicy Lobster Spaghetti and Prime Boneless Ribeye. I appreciated the large chucks of tender lobster and how saucy the spaghetti was. Ribeye was on par with expectations. The sides were especially impressive. The Potatoes Rustica was perfectly crispy, and the Mushroom Marsala was very juicy. Both were seasoned just right. Also very generous servings! We were sad that we didn't have room to try their famous 17-layer chocolate cake. Must return...\\n\\nService was very attentive.

We got the pork, duck, chicken combo with rice all for $6.75. That price in this economy is literally unheard of!! It was filling for me honestly and I thought the meats were so juicy and it came with some cabbage. Be prepared to wait in line but honestly it's so worth it. We waited around half an hour before being able to enter the establishment. \\n\\nFYI they take cash only!!!!\", \"There seems to be a really solid hype around this place and ultimately it was worth waiting for. We probably waited on line for maybe half an hour? It went surprisingly slowly, not sure why. There are only really four people in the restaurant at a time.\\n\\nWe went with the roasted pork/duck dish and roasted pig. The small option really does give you a ton of meat. The pork was my favorite, nicely seasoned without being overly fatty. The duck was pretty nice, too, if a bit harder to eat as it was still attached to bone. The pig was my least favorite, as it was fairly salty and would have been difficult to eat without the rice. \\n\\nIt's a simple, compact, and well done dish of rice, cabbage, and meat. Nicely cheap and exactly what you're expecting when you see the meat hanging in the window. And when you do get your food, there's a lovely park across the street for you to eat it in.\", \"Wah Fung No 1 is an unassuming chop-shop style carry-out restaurant with fast service that serves a variety of meat dishes over rice. The long line outside can seem daunting at first, but it is simply a sign of the flavorful meals being served inside and moves rather quickly.\\n\\nI came here with a friend and ordered the Roasted Duck w/ White Rice, while my friend got the Roasted Pork w/ White Rice. While the Roasted Pork was wonderful, I was blown away by the Roasted Duck. I cannot stress enough how flavorful, juicy, and succulent the duck was and how well it paired with the bed of white rice. There is a small portion of cabbage that is served on the side with the rice as well that provides the perfect amount of crunch to the meal. All in all, this was one of the best take out meals I've had in New York to date - if you find yourself in the Lower East Side or Chinatown anytime soon, definitely give this place a try and order the Roasted Duck w/ White Rice!\", \"This is really the best bang for your buck. So cheap and so fulfilling - Wah Fung No 1 satisfies your chinese craving. There are options between roasted pork, char siu pork (more like bbq), and roasted duck. \\n\\nI would avoid coming on a weekend, the wait was 45-1 hour long. There is definitely a more efficient system that they could adopt so that the line moves quickly but they're just 2 old chinese men that are servicing the crowd. So please be patient with them! \\n\\nWe ordered the roasted pork (with the crispy skin on top) small bowl and another roasted duck and charsiu pork small bowl combo. It comes with steamed rice and cabbage - I loved that they included a veggie side because that really balanced the flavors. Everything came out to under $12, I believe. Although the line was long, it was worth the wait. Very delicious and authentic hong kong dish.\", \"Wah Fung No. 1 has long been a beloved cornerstone of Chinatown, known for its quick, affordable, and delicious meals.

Honestly, I probably wouldnt wait that long again. Great food, and it would be better if the line was shorter :P\", 'The pork over rice for $5.75 is just amazing. The flavors are 10/10 and the price is unbeatable. The line to get it is long but worth it - it does by quick. The place is small so you just take it to go.', 'This place lives up to his hype! The line was long since we came on a Saturday but it was worth the wait. We waited for about 20 min and ordered the pork over rice which comes with cabbage for $5.95. The rice was fluffy and delicious, the cabbage was tender and tasty, and the pork was incredibly tasty with a slight hint of sweetness. I will try the duck next time I come for sure!', \"The line speaks for itself. This restaurant is always packed because the roast pork, duck, chicken, and pig are well prepared and served with white rice and cabbage that completes the meal. It's a cash only establishment, and most large meals are under $10, so you can guarantee you're getting your money's worth. The gentlemen serving the food are fast, efficient, and also polite. Take time to read the menu and confirm you know what you want before you begin conversing with them. If you're not ready, it's perfectly fine to let the next person go ahead, so this way everyone can be served as quickly as possible.\", 'food: BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!!!

However, I gave this place a try twice now and both times were disappointed with the bbq pork. Many thin and dry pieces that were tough to chew. It really depends on what piece of the meat they cut for you (could be the tender, meatier part or the tail end part). The only good thing was the chicken. \\nAlso try to bring smaller change because I only had a $50 bill and they kept giving me the wrong change back until 3 tries later.\", \"I think TikTok has ruined this experience. It's good food... but it's not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for. You can find equally good places all over Chinatown. \\n\\nI came at 9:30am and still waited 20 minutes.

The value is good, but not worth the wait. \\n\\nI've seen 50-60 people in line. You've been duped by Instagram. As a local - go to Big Wong on Mott. Actual quality cuts\", \"Tried the 3 meats. The pork was clearly the best. I see why this has garnered such attention for the price point and serving size but for me, I didn't really think it was worth waiting over an hour in line for. \\n\\nThe meat has a candied quality to it which is good but many bits I found hard to eat. \\n\\nThe process is efficient and it's a decent meal but I personally won't go out of my way to come  back again. \\n\\nI appreciate that this is a no nonsense, straight to the point type of place that focuses on their specialty items.\", \"Really good value meal. All the meats sold are of decent or above average quality with my favorite being the roast pork.

I don\\'t eat pork so I got chicken, however I was scared to try it because all the meat is cut a chopped on the same boards with the same knives (cross contamination of the pork & chicken).\\n\\nThe pork my boy got he really enjoyed...

Give them a try, I love the food.\", 'Enjoy Chinatown cheap eats and Wah Fung No. 1 is a classic hole-in-the-wall, specializing in delicious roast meats. If you plan on going: (1) be prepared for waiting in the line that extends down Chrystie to Hester which could take 40 or so minutes to get through and (2) don\\'t show up close to closing because they can run out of food... because it\\'s (deservedly) extremely popular. (The hardworking team behind the counter preparing each order work their tails off!)\\n\\nWah Fung\\'s \"everyday special\" is their smaller roast pork or chicken portion on white rice for $5.50, but I\\'m a fan of roast duck - so my choice was a large portion of a 2 meat combo - roast pork and duck for $8! Note - In addition to steamed cabbage, they add juices from the roasted meats on top of the rice. All moist and yum!\\n\\nKeep in mind - There is also only space to order and not to eat. Cash only!\\n\\nWah Fung No. 1\\'s a place I\\'d definitely recommend! That being said, hope to discover a time frame when the line is typically shorter so I can accordingly schedule my next visit!', \"So this place is known for Chinese comfort food, fast and in a hurry, just like the city in which it was born.  It is affordable great food under $10.00, and the affordability doesn't compromise the quality of food or the service. I absolutely love roast duck and I usually order it throughout the city. Wah Fung No 1 does not disappoint, they continue to roast and season ducks to perfection. The skin is crispy  and the meat is tender. The steamed cabbage is also tender. The sauce they add to the white rice adds flavor to the dish. The roast pork is tendered and moist. \\n\\nPlease come early because the word has been out, this is also a tourist's spot. This restaurant is a part of the (LES) Lower East Side culture and the lines go down the block. There were only three people in line today at 9am (yes I said 9am). \\n\\nThese guys can move a line, they've been doing this for a while.\\n\\nThere is no indoor seating and they only take cash.\", \"My friend told me about this popular place within tourists and locals all alike. She said it's bustling with people at different hours from the start til closing time. No kidding. Line is pretty long when I've arrived. Waiting from the back of the line to get to the front might take about half an hour to one hour, depending on if you get here on the weekdays or during the weekends. Located not too far away from the B/D trains.\\n\\nService is okay-ish but I mostly go for the pretty affordable food so that's alright. Just a storefront btw so there're no outdoor/indoor chairs + tables aka find your own place to eat. The vibes of the ambiance is no-frills and more of a grab-and-go kind of spot. Price wise is under $10. \\n\\nI ordered 1 small protein (chicken) over rice. They give so much meat and pack everything in a disposable aluminum tin foil container. A small ($5.50) is already enough and fulfilling for one person while a big one ($7.50) is good for 2 people. \\n\\nThe dark chicken meat is very tender and flavorful but not overly salty unlike other places. Not too many bones overall. You can request for more cabbage (veggies) over the rice. The rice is tasty with the sauce from the chicken. The small choice of meat over rice makes a really good lunch/dinner. It's cash only though.\", \"I LOVE when a restaurant focuses on what they're great at and executes it perfectly, that's what I was expecting here and that's what we got!\\n\\nWe got there around 11 and waited maybe 20 minutes, but lucky it was a beautiful day.  We got the roast duck and they really pack a lot in there, soooo yummy and can't really beat the price. \\n\\nIt's a small place, no sitting area but a nice shady park right across the street is perfect to sit and eat in. \\n\\nDefinitely will be back when I'm back in the city(:\", 'Saw this spot on IG so headed over to Chinatown and found a line.  About 20 before us around 2:00 on a Thursday afternoon.  Pick up and cash only.  Street parking or nearby lot or garage.  \\n\\nThe line moved  fast (about 15 minutes) and they had various roasted Protein (Duck, Chicken etc) on display at the window.\\n\\nSimple menu-rice with protein and I saw small or large sizes.  We went with Roasted Pork (looked like this was the signature dish) and Roasted Duck.  Pork was boneless and delicious and was our favorite.  Duck was with bone and was tasty also.\\nChicken looked good also-next time.\\nSimple ingredients coming together very nicely.\\n\\nGentleman preparing the food was hustling and fun to watch.  Service was friendly.  Make this stop in Chinatown for some simple ingredient deliciousness!', \"This is a very small cash only shop with two workers. Despite the line, my order was taken very quickly! We ordered the roast chicken and roast duck. The roast chicken was not good, I wouldn't get it again bc we couldn't even finish it. There were so many bone/cartilage pieces making it hard to eat, 4/10. The roast duck on the other hand was phenomenal. It was savory and sweet (it was a bit too sweet for my cousin but I loved it). The rice was also really tasty and it came with steamed cabbage. I really enjoyed this meal and would come back for the roast duck alone. 10/10!\", 'To find Wah Fung just look for the line. There is consistently a line of people down the street waiting to order. The shop is indeed a hole in the wall. Very narrow standing room only. Maybe 3 to 4 people at a time ordering. The menu is small (pork duck or chicken) and service is quick. \\n\\nI ordered the small roast pork with rice for 5.50 and took it across the street to the park to enjoy. The bowl was hearty, pork tender and fatty packed with flavor 10/10. All the reviews will be the exact same. Get this!', \"There's always a long line and have heard so much about this place from Reddit, YouTube, TikTok. I had a redeye flight and found myself here right when it opened around 9am, and there was no line at all.\\n\\nI ordered 2 meats over rice which is about $8.50. Specifically I got roast pork and duck, and since I was so early I was the first order for this so I got the fresh roast brand new meat, and man I think that made a huge difference than getting it later in the day. The meat was MOIST and flavorful. I really liked the pork more than the duck. Super crispy skin and really porky seasoned taste. The duck in my opinion was ok nothing too crazy. I'm comparing this to Sam Woo out in the 626 California pretty much. I think the pork was way better and if I had to order again I'd get only the pork. \\n\\nFor $8.50 this is hard to beat I know next door there is New Kim Tuong right next door for like $2 cheaper, but the consensus I read was that it's a tier below but obviously no line. \\n\\nWah Fung was quick and very tasty for me but I went right when they opened. I don't think I'd wait in line for an hour for it, but it's for sure good and lived up to the hype as a very tasty and affordable meal.\\n\\nThey do also take cash only so don't wait in line if you don't have it!\", \"If this review is finding you while you're waiting on a massive line, wondering if Wah Fung No 1's legendary $5.75 roast pork is worth it, I'm here to tell you it is. Stick it out. You want this. Trust me. Work for it.\\n\\nI made the mistake of coming here at lunch time, which meant that my wait time was longer than what most folks have said if you come during off hours. I got on like at around 1 pm, and waited around 30 minutes or so before reaching Wah Fung's doors. \\n\\nIf you're here, you're either getting roast pork or roast duck over rice with cabbage. I opted for roast pork solely based on visual appeal and definitely made the right choice. For $5.75 you get a small container with some rice (but not too much rice), steamed flavorful cabbage and roast pork piled high onto your dish, topped off with the delicious juice it was cooked in. If you're thirsty there's a small fridge in the back you're welcome to grab a soda or water out of, but know that options are limited. \\n\\nMy water and small pork ran under $7, and I was in and out quickly. The ambiance of this place is just two guys working their butts off to chop and serve roast pork and duck like machines, so you'll need to eat your pork to go at the nearby park or wherever else you can pop a squat.\\n\\n10/10, hype is well deserved in my opinion. I wish I took a photo but I was too hungry this time, sorry.\", \"I was very disappointed after all the hype from reviews and social media. It's a lot of food for a cheap price and that's probably the only reason to come here. I had to wait about 40 minutes on a Sunday at 10am. The bbq pork was inconsistent, some very juicy flavorful bites here and there but a lot of dry or too fatty pieces. What was even more disappointing was that the rice was a little dry and hard and the cabbage was bland. Honestly there are other places, one even 2 stores down that has just as good food, if not better, for the same price with no wait time.\", 'FINALLY!!! They opened back up after a while of being closed. $6 for the small bowl with pork and duck, which was amazing. The duck is a little hard to debone, and the lack of cabbage made me a little sad, but overall I loved the experience.\\n\\nThe line is long, but I feel like they were efficient', \"Came at 5:45pm on a Wednesday and the line only took 15 mins. I came with my gf so we only ordered 1 large with 3 meats (chicken, duck, and roast BBQ pork) to share because we wanted to try more Chinatown eats! This was so worth $8.50 considering how much food and meat was given! If you wanted a smaller container with 1 meat, it would be $5.50 , which is still a great deal! The shop is fairly small and only 3 people should be standing inside to order. The park across the street is also a great place to eat it at! Definitely would go back and because it's a staple for Chinatown! \\nDelicious food! I would go for the roast pork, chicken then duck if I were to rank the meats and they give veggies as well! Well balanced!\", \"I once gave Wah Fung 5 stars.  At the time I guess I liked it but I never had the urge to go back.  As I have seen it more and more on social media I felt I needed to try it again.  We went at 4 pm on a Wednesday.  The line was long.  We waited in the line for about an hour.  Even at Disney I would wake away from a line that long.  In my opinion nothing is worth an hour in a line.  In the end Wah Fung was 3 stars not because of the line (that isn't fully their fault) but more because the food is mediocre.\\n\\nOnce you get inside you have the option of chicken, char sui or a combo. \\n\\nThe char sui is a nice portion but honestly sort of tasteless and many pieces were just too fatty.  The rice had 0 taste to it even with the juice poured onto it.\\n\\nThe line is slow.  There were two workers inside.  They had to prep, portion and collect the money.  If they just had a 3rd person working the line would move much quicker.\\n\\nI won't be back\", \"There are very few food spots that have good prices and good food. Wah Fung No.1 has both. Their roasted pork and duck plate with white rice was one of the most delicious meals I've had in so long. The line took almost 30 minutes of wait time, but I feel like it was definitely worth it. I'm definitely coming back to eat here again. \\n\\nNote: This restaurant only accepts cash. There is also no indoor or outdoor seating, but there is a nearby park with benches!\", 'Worth every hype review of this place! I was told this is a hotspot in Chinatown -- its simple:\\n\\n-$5.50 for a small plate / $8.50 for a large\\n-choice of roast duck, pork, chicken or half/half over rice \\n-CASH ONLY! \\n\\nWhen I say every bite was delicious and well seasoned, I am not lying! We came at around 5pm and the line went down to the corner but it was worth the wait + the line moves pretty fast. Make sure to add this on your itinerary when visiting NYC!', \"Well priced roasted meat dishes and a cash only type of to-go restaurant. If you're in the area, it's worth buying one rice plate.\\n\\nPre-covid the meat was perfectly juicy and tender, but during this recent trip (Oct '24) we went around opening time and our meat was on the dry side, it appeared overcooked. My husband thought we may have gone too early and the meat was from the previous day. Sadly, I think he was right. The taste was there but the meat was tough. \\n\\nI'd say it's still worth the $5 or $7 per rice dish price but avoid opening hour.\", \"During our weekend getaway, my husband and I decided to try Wah Fung No. 1 for its famous Cantonese-style barbecue and roasted pork. The line was ridiculously long--we waited 40 minutes! While waiting, I asked some locals if it was worth it, and they assured me the special sauce and roasted pork were worth the wait. They recommended just getting the roasted pork, so that's what we did. I'm glad I listened to them because the small bowl was filling and delicious, with tender roasted pork served over steamed cabbage and rice. The sauce was fantastic! We took our food to go and enjoyed it on a bench in front of the park while watching kids play. Note that this place only takes cash and has no sitting area. Would I come again? Yes, if I am in Chinatown, but I hope the line is a bit shorter next time!\", \"I don't get it.\\nWaited 20min in line but after a few bites, we had to throw them away in a trash. We were not into the Pork nor the Duck unfortunately. May be we are not their target customers.\", \"This place is worth the long line that moves fairly quickly. It's a very small space. The line moves orderly and quickly. They have limited options but do not let that sway you. Sometimes, less truly is best. Roasted pork, BBQ roasted pork, Roasted Pig, Duck and Chicken were their options. I could not for the life of me figure out what could be the difference between roasted pork and roasted pig lol So I asked some folks who looked to be regulars there. They explained that the roasted pork was essentially boneless ribs and that roasted pig was essentially pork belly. As my eyes lit up, I just knew. I had to get both. My daughter wanted the duck and roasted pork combo. We waited a short 20 minutes to get in front. We got in, put in our order and watched the chef make it right in front of us. We love that. We paid the cashier lady in cash only for 3 meals about $22, unbelievable in this economy. Phenomenal, may I say. That included 2 drinks as well. We took to the local park benches to enjoy because they have no seating. \\n\\nThe roasted pork was juicy and flavorful and spot on with the boneless rib reference from our friendly line dwellers. The roasted pig was deliciously fatty, well seasoned and nothing like it's counterpart. Very different in texture, flavor and fattiness. The duck baby girl had, was possibly the best duck (not a big fan) I've ever had and something I'd consider ordering again for myself. It all comes with white rice and cabbage. Chef puts the flavorful brown sauce over the meats and rice. It was delicious and we could not finish it all. Leftovers were a blessing. All in all I'd give this place 4.5 stars. I'll definitely be back soon. Can't get that roast pig outta my head.\", 'I came around 10:15am on a Friday morning and there was already a line! I waited about 15 minutes. I ordered the char sui pork bowl over rice, it was only $5.50. They are cash only. \\n\\nThe bowl was very filling and the pork was very tasty. It was sweet and savory, the bowl itself was quite large so it is super good value. Some of my pork pieces were a little dry but overall it was delicious.', \"Been on my radar for a very long time. Last time I was in NYC before this trip they had some emergency construction or something at the time so they were closed and I couldn't go. Luckily I got a chance to go this time. If you don't know, this place is known for some solid quality cheap eats. I'm talking like $6.50 for a small pork and rice bowl and around 8.50 as a combo. I think when. First heard about them the small single entree was $5.50 but it's still a great deal. \\n\\nWe came pretty early in the morning so there was only a medium short line thankfully. Line moved at a fairly reasonable pace. \\n\\nI'm not a huge duck guy, but we were already there so I figured I might as well give it a shot . My portion wasn't that great but my friend said hers was pretty tender and moist. as for the pork that was by far my favorite. It's the thing that drew me to this place.

My taste buds were more than satisfied--they were in heaven. We got the Scallop DIY Gimbap and everything went so well together especially with the uni add-on. I will say though, the scallops were thinner than I thought. Next, the Dolsot Al-Bap came and it was mixed well for us. Another must get dish. It was creamy and all around very delicious. The next two dishes that arrived were the Hap-Cheon Pork Soup and the Duck Bulgogi. The soup was a little on the spicy side, but was tolerable (this is coming from someone who doesn't have a great spice tolerance) and the Duck Bulgogi was flavorful. \\n\\nThis is definitely a restaurant I will be bringing more friends to, so I can try new dishes AND reorder some of these dishes. With these four dishes being shared between 3 people, it did not fill us all the way so I'd recommend getting another dish to share. \\n\\nWe had made a reservation the day before for 8pm, but it seemed to not be busy on a Sunday night so you might not need any reservations!\", 'Intimate, fun Korean spot in East Village! Really delicious homages to Busan food.\\n\\nMade a res beforehand, easy and quick sit down, and good variety of appetizers and entrees to finish. Service was very attentive and quick to help us with anything needed. Ordered the items in the pics, and had no leftovers for just two! Had slightly higher expectations going in, but still beautiful and delicious.', \"Such an amazingggggg Korean restaurant! Great selection of tapas style plates and everything was absolutely phenomenal. Everything was very flavorful and seasoned well. Honorable mentions for the following: \\n\\ndolsot al bap - easily one of the best things i have ever ate. crispy, burnt, flavorful rice, paired with the creaminess of the sea urchin cream. I'm not the biggest fan of sea urchin, but the flavors of this dish paired beautifully together. \\n\\nseafood pancake - they really perfected the crunchy exterior while retaining the soft/mochi-like interior of this dish. \\n\\nservice was great and food was so delicious I can't wait to go back!\", \"I was able to get a last minute reservation on a Tuesday and it did not disappoint. I've been meaning to try this place for a while but the timings never worked out until now. \\n\\nWe were seated promptly at our reservation time of 730 PM. We ordered the following and our reviews:\\n\\n- scallop gimbap: 4.5/5: fresh. rice had a nice nutty flavor to it. the scallops were sliced super thin so -.5 for the amount. \\n- seafood pancake: 3.5/5: not as crunchy as I would like my seafood pancake. it also was a bit too oily for my taste. \\n- fried eel: 4/5: had this as our last dish, I probably would've given it 4.5 if I wasn't so full but this was one of my favorite dishes. \\n- fried soft shell crabs: 4/5: didn't feel as oily and had a nice crunch and flavor to it. I added too much sauce for the first crab and it overpowered it. so I advise to use a smaller portion of sauce to crab ratio. \\n- dolsot al-bap with uni: 5/5: my favorite dish of the night. it had a really great seafood flavor and the uni was such a great add on and added more flavor to it. highly recommend this dish. \\n\\ncomplimentary kimchi was also SO GOOD. got 2 dishes of it!\\n\\nthe service was spectacular and very attentive. super friendly and welcoming and accommodating!\", 'We dined there for dinner yesterday. Delicious Korean food options. The place was cool and has great vibe. Nice dining setting. The staff was friendly and give us food recommendation. \\nWe ordered the Beef Tartare and Soft Shell Crab which has nice flavor. The Dolsot AL Bap was really great and so amazing. Nice food portions too. The Jangeo was so tasty and it nice texture that really melts into my mouth. I enjoyed the food so much.', 'ARIARI is an incredible Korean restaurant serving up some of the best Korean food I\\'ve ever had!\\n\\nBooked a last minute reservation for a group of 6 people at 8:45 pm on a Saturday. Since the restaurant is pretty small, and was super packed, we weren\\'t seated until ~9; however, the food was definitely worth the wait! The menu is formatted as a \"tapas style\", so the waiter recommended that we order ~2 dishes per person. Here\\'s what we ordered:\\n\\nScallop DIY Gimbap: (5/5) If there\\'s anything that you can take away from this review, is to order the Scallop DIY Gimbap!! The scallops were so sweet and fresh, and paired perfectly with all of the accompaniments. I could eat 10 of these!!\\n\\nBeef Su-Yuk: (5/5) Originally felt indifferent towards this when we were ordering; however, the broth is truly out of this world. Would definitely recommend! \\n\\nDosot-Al Bap: (5/5) By far my favorite thing that I ate at ARIARI. The uni cream is addicting, and pairs perfectly with the warm rice without being too fishy or overpowering. Definitely make sure you eat this hot to preserve the uni flavor! And add on fresh uni!!!\\n\\nDuck Bulgogi: (5/5) Such a unique pairing that ended up being sooo delicious. The fatty duck paired with the salty umami sauce was a match made in heaven!\\n\\nSeafood Pancake: (4/5) I love seafood pancake and this one definitely lived up to all my expectations. The pieces of seafood were nice and big, and the pancake itself was perfectly crispy!\\n\\nSeafood Butter Gui: (4/5) As a seafood lover this was my absolute dream! Every single seafood was perfectly cooked and seasoned to buttery perfection. I loved how it came with pita because it created this perfect little vessel for all of the delicious seafood!\\n\\nFried Soft Shell Crab: (3/5) While the rest of the table loved this one, I was pretty indifferent towards it. While it was still delicious, after a while it felt too oily compared to the other dishes.\\nSeafood Japchae', 'More like 3.5 stars. \\n\\nMade reservations for 6:15pm on a Sunday and they were accomodating when I said we were running a bit late, but they do give your table away after 15 mins and you are only allowed to be seated for a max of 2 hours. Restaurant was fully seated when we arrived. \\n\\nThe menu itself is not that extensive. When you are seated they recommend to order 2 dishes from the smaller plates and 2 of the more shareable dishes. They encourage people to share dishes and to not order 1/person. Everything is smaller portioned. \\n\\nThey give out \"kimchi salad\". Essentially was like gutjeori. This had good flavor and had a nice kick. Ordered the seafood pancake and soft shelled crab. These were VERY OILY. Each bite dripping with oil. Overpowered the flavors and made it very unpleasant to eat. The sweet cold noodles were decent and I enjoyed it. Many pieces of salmon. The spicy fish soup had a nice kick to it as well. It came with sujaebi, radish, bean sprouts and fish. More liquid than the contents of the soup, but overall pretty good. It came with a bowl of rice. To finish it off we ordered the corn creme brulee and I really liked it. This is a cold dessert. I liked the flavor of corn and the corn pieces. Also it was creamy and ended the meal on a good note. Also ordered the maesil cocktail. This was refreshing and good. I like the taste of maesil so this was nice drink to pair with the meal. \\n\\n\\nThe service was really good. Various servers checking in on us and very nice when bringing food to us. Updating us when food would be coming and apologizing for wait even though there wasn\\'t that long of a wait. \\n\\nOverall a decent experience. Wouldn\\'t be dying to come back, but I was glad I came to check this place out during my NY trip.', \"One of the best meals I had in NYC. The seafood was so fresh and the dishes were quite unique. The egg souffle was so fluffy and creamy and I loved how the rice stuck a bit to the pot -- this is a must order. The scallop kimbap was a another favorite, it was so fresh, and you assemble it to get the perfect bite of everything. The fried chicken also surprised me, I thought the crust was quite unique and it was so juicy inside. We also had the spicy udon noodles, pork soup, and soft shell crab and recommend them as well.\\n\\nA cant-miss spot in NY, will not that it can get quite loud inside so might not be a great place if you're trying to talk a lot.\", \"Solid Korean spot in East Village. We tried the beef tartare, duck bulgogi, dolsot al bap and fried chicken. \\n\\n- Beef tartare is eaten in a seaweed wrap, kind of like a gimbap. I thought the octopus paired well with the dish and liked the fact that this had a hint of sweetness to it (I'm not a huge fan of beef tartare that has a strong taste of the raw beef lol)\\n- Dolsot al bap was very tasty! Of course the sea urchin cream is great for pics. The taste of the cream isn't super strong after it is mixed but overall still delicious. And it goes well with any mains you order\\n- Duck Bulgogi - this caught my eye since I had never seen duck bulgogi before. The duck was tender and tasty\\n- Fried chicken - the chicken was lightly fried with a thin outer shell, which is a bit different from your typical korean fried chicken. Flavor wise, I thought dish was the least unique\\n\\nWe came on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was generally busy throughout the night. I would recommend making a reservation just in case!\", 'Pretty solid Korean place with some interesting dishes. The soft shell crab and the pork stew were my favorites.', \"My visit to ARIARI is part of my ongoing exploration of Hand Hospitality's restaurant portfolio. I visited when they first opened last year, and they've since opened many more restaurants. I came in specifically wanting the egg souffle with uni. The presentation was promising, with the uni perched atop the egg souffle, but I was disappointed by their tableside mixing. The delicate flavor of the uni was lost in the process, leaving behind a somewhat bland amalgamation that did not justify its price point.\\n\\nThe scallop roll, on the other hand, was divine. I'm a big fan of raw scallop and considered this to be a highlight of the meal. The freshness and texture and even the fun of building my own hand roll made it a dish I'd gladly return for.\\n\\nThe fried eel was a mixed bag. Maybe other people would like the meatiness but I found it overwhelming. The deep fried soft shell crab was fine, but didn't leave a lasting impression. Lastly, I loved the seafood udon-- such a basic dish but it totally hit the spot. \\n\\nI'd like to give a nod to their cocktail program-- the drink I had with gochugaru was smooth and well balanced. \\n\\nMaybe not every dish at ARIARI hit the mark, it occupies a popular niche of trendy Korean restaurants that I quite enjoy, so I think it warrants a visit.\", \"OMG. To give a brief background, as a Korean and as someone who doesn't really like fusion-type foods, I'm usually super picky when it comes to Korean-fusion-esque places.\\n\\nARIARI, however, was simply amazing. I LOVED the dolsot albap (perfect balance of creamy), the hwe was fresh and fantastic, and the maeuntang was soo refreshing. Even the side dish kimchi was some of the best kimchi I've had a restaurant in a long time.\\n\\nService was fast and good, and the ambiance was perfect to have some soju and catchup with friends. Definitely will be coming back!!!\", \"Wow I had high expectations for this place and it still didn't disappoint! \\n\\nPretty much every dish we got was really good. Here are the most popular: \\n- Dolsot Al Bap - a must try!! It's creamy, umami, filling. I would come back just for this dish. \\n- Fried Sea Eel & Eggplant - it's sweet and savory with a nice crunch from the pecans. Our table really liked this. \\n- Duck Bulgogi \\n- Mak Hwe - sashimi with lettuce wraps. Really fresh\\n- Seafood pancake \\n- Fried chicken \\n\\nService was fast. The ambiance was a little dark but it wasn't overwhelming to the point that it affected our experience. Highly recommend coming here!!\", \"Make sure you reserve a few days in advance or else you won't be able to get a spot here. I ordered the fried soft shell crab, beef su yuk, and dolsot al bap and THEY WERE ALL SO GOOD. Honestly there's not much else to say because each dish was very delicious. The broth especially had a deep flavor and I highly recommend it on a cold day. I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes!\", 'Glad to try Ariari. Loved the space and overall ambiance albeit a bit cozy. The kimchi banchan has a great mix of spiciness, sweetness and seafood umami. I would get the raw fish and Yookhwe dishes again. \\n\\nFried eel dish was nice. The soy glaze was nicely sweet and reminded me of the Bonchon soy flavor. I do want to caveat that the eggplant-fried eel ratio might be more like 60 fried eel / 40 eggplant.', \"ARIARI has been on my radar for a while now, so I was happy to go when my partner and I found a table available over the weekend.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes included the scallop gimbap (Scallop was very fresh and the pairings were delectable) and the Yook-Hwe (very unique with the baby Octopus mixed in).\\n\\nA couple dishes that left me wanting more were the Dolsot Al-Bap (while I liked it, I didn't really get the hype on this one) and the seafood butter-gui (I think it may have been more satisfying if it came out piping hot, it came out warm and was just meh).\\n\\nService was friendly with decent pacing. Would come back to try the pork cheek, which was sold out that evening.\", 'Came here with two friends and we enjoyed our time. Service is great and food is delicious, although the portions are on the smaller side. \\n\\nAppetizers: yook hwe (beef tartare) and fried soft shell crab. Both were delicious!\\n\\nMains: dolsot al-bap with uni - was super excited to try this and it was good. It was exactly what we expected and we just wish there was more! Duck bulgogi - was very tender and good but nothing super special. Beef su-yuk - we were most surprised by this! The clear broth was so flavorful and there was a good amount of beef too.', \"Nut allergy friendly: Nothing we had had any concerns. I don't think anything they use has nuts.\\n\\nWow. This probably ranks into my top 3 Korean restaurants in the US. It's a quaint shop from the outside that I almost walked by despite following directions, but it's packed with flavor.\\n\\nWe made a reservation two weeks ahead when they opened up and were promptly seated. \\n\\nOrder-to-Dishes: Roughly 13-19 mins for appetizers, 23 mins for sharable entrees.\\n\\nFor three people, we ordered:\\n-Kimchi (complimentary): Excellent. Great balance, not too acidic.\\n-Seafood Butter-Gui (5/5): An interesting Mediterranean feeling dish with the pita, but it blends the butter with delicious seafood and the perfect accompaniments to balance out each bite.\\n-Seafood Pancake (5/5): They manage to get squid or shrimp or mussels into each bite of the pancake. Stellar texture. Delicious balance with the chive and basil.\\n-Fried Soft Shell Crab (6/5): Holy smokes. Must order. Not sure how they fry this but it is excellently crispy and still fresh tasting at the same time.\\n-Fried Chicken (4.5/5): I give this a good rating for excellent portions. It's fried in a similar way as the soft shell crab. I think it was a bit weaker in texture but overall, still very good.\\n-Duck Bulgogi (4/5): While this was the weakest dish in my opinion, the duck was still very tender and flavorful. I think it should have been served with some rice or something other than beansprouts. \\n-Spicy Fish Stew (4/5): Went very well with rice, very tender fish and clams but not enough to share with 3 people. \\n-Seafood Japchae (5/5): The heck did they do to make this Japchae so good? The octopus perfectly balanced the Japchae texture and it's a great level of spice.\\n\\nThe quality of seafood was overall excellent.\\n\\nWith two drinks it came out to roughly $75/pp.\\nI'd definitely come back if only for the soft shell crab, and highly recommend.\", \"I loved everything!!!! \\n\\nThe scallop DIY was so fun and fresh, the dolsot al-bap was so creamy and delicious, and the beef soup was comforting and deep in flavor. \\n\\nOnly negative is your reservation is only like 1.5 hours and they're very strict on the time. They'll start telling you how much time you have left starting at 20 min left or so. So don't be late!\", \"So so happy to have finally tried this spot!! I've never had Korean food from Busan style this did not disappoint. Most dishes were unique to me and incorporated seafood of some sort. Everything looked sooo tasty and I'd come back to try more dishes. We walked in at 5pm on a Thursday and was a bit surprised how empty it was - but I was glad to sit down immediately. Service was really good and everyone was so kind. As it approached 6PM, the restaurant quickly became crowded and I was glad we beat the crowd. \\n\\nWe had two people and got the DIY gimbap, dolsat al bap, spicy fish stew, and soft shell crab. The scallops tasted so fresh. We recently are warming up to uni but we loved the Dolsat al bap - it didn't taste briney which is what we don't like usually. The presentation was beautiful and we loved this dish. The fish stew was so so comforting, the fish tasted fresh and the tteok inside was so chewy and flavorful. We last minute added the soft shell crab and omg I've never had it like this before. It was so crunchy - like a chip - but the meaty part was so meaty. It was a standout for sure. The complimentary kimchi was unique but so tasty and fresh, we ate it so fast. We also got a bottle of the cheapest soju which was from Busan, and it was the smoothest soju I've had. Everything was amazing and I loved the experience here.\", \"AriAri is an authentic Korean restaurant from Busan.\\n\\nHere's what you should order:\\n\\n * Scallop DIY (incredibly fresh!)\\n * Seafood pancake (packed with squid, shrimp, and mussels--absolutely amazing)\\n * Fried soft shell crab (lightly fried, with tender, meaty texture)\\n * Fried chicken (crispy with a delicate crunch--still trying to figure out how they do it!)\\n * Beef su yuk (a comforting, flavorful soup)\\n * Dolsot al-bap hot stone rice (add the sea urchin--it's so creamy and delicious)\\n * Corn creme brulee (sweet, custardy perfection)\\n\\nI'd skip the fried sea eel. Though I usually enjoy freshwater eel, I wasn't a fan of the sauce here.\\n\\nOverall, you won't go wrong with anything on the menu. Highly recommended!\", \"Surprisingly delicious food, especially for the seafood lovers. The restaurant has a casual vibe and transports you to Busan with cute scenic pictures all over the walls. The cocktails were good, but the highlight is of course the food. The scallop gimbap melts in your mouth and I'm still dreaming about the dolsot al-bap (a sort of seafood rice mixed with uni cream). The spicy fish stew was also perfect to warm you up!\\n\\nI'll definitely be going back and highly recommend this spot.\", \"I am so glad I got to finally try Ariari! It was really hard to get reservations when they first opened but now it's no longer difficult. The inside is really small and they have an outdoor space as well. \\n\\nThe food here is very authentic. I would definitely not take someone here if they didn't like seafood. A lot of dishes contain seafood. My favorite dish was the pork jowl soup! It was so refreshing. The food is tapas style so we got around 5 dishes for three people and we had leftovers. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that they don't have side dishes except kimchi. Not necessarily a deal breaker- more of a nice to have.\", 'Had dinner here this week with a good friend who loves a good Korean joint as much as I do. \\n\\nI was a bit biased against this one, given the cautionary language that popped up into my ressie confirmation text message.  It notifies you that you are given an allotment of an hour and 45 mins for dining, and a 15 minute grace period for checking in (something that many trendy restaurants have started embracing recently, and which, I find annoying). \\n\\nSo as luck would have it, my friend\\'s train decided not to run, and she ended up arriving super late. I was already seated with a cocktail in hand (the gin and Korean pear one, which somehow reminded me of a Manhattan type of cocktail for some reason). The restaurant did not stress me out about her lateness, which I appreciated. \\n\\nWe were advised to order 2 dishes per person, so we ordered the Japchae (with lots of crunchy wood ear mushrooms, such a treat), The lotus root salad, the fish stew, and fried squid and monkfish.  It was ample food, and we had enough leftovers to take home.  The complimentary Kimchi \"salad\" was phenomenal and so addictive that we got 3 plates worth.  We really enjoyed all of the dishes, even the lotus root salad, which some critics have complained about for its heavy dressing.  The flavors in all plates were complex, the textures and seasoning, perfect. I especially loved the lightness of the fish stew, with the herbal notes of what I believe were baby chrysanthemum greens, its broth so full of shellfish flavor.  \\n\\nWe were not rushed, and service was perfectly attentive.\\n\\nSometimes, you brace yourself for a super- hyped up restaurant that ends up being mediocre.  But I have to say, this one was definitely worthwhile.  Hope to visit again soon to try some of the other dishes.', \"Totally understand why reservations here fill up so quickly - the food is delicious! I made a reservation for Ariari right when the date opened up on Resy, and within the first few minutes, some of the time slots were taken already! But it is well worth the effort to make the resy.\\n\\n2-3 plates are recommended per person, and the portions are decently sized for tapas. My friend and I split the DIY scallop gimbab with uni, yookhoe, fried soft shell crab, and the dolsot al-bab. There isn't really any banchan per se, but their kimchi is really well seasoned and tasty. DIY scallop gimbab was easily a favorite for me. The scallops & uni were both fresh, and I really enjoyed the DIY aspect. Yookhoe is well seasoned, fried soft shell crab is super crispy and tasty, and the dolsot al-bab just rounds it out perfectly with some carbs. \\n\\nService here is A++. The staff allowed me sit inside first while waiting for my friend even though I've read that they try to stick to the 2-hr dining limit. \\n\\nAmbiance is cozy; the restaurant is actually smaller than I expected, which makes getting a resy a must. They do have an outside dining shed, but I much prefer being indoors!\", \"Literally one of the best meals I've had since I don't know when. Every dish was so good. We came around 7p on a Thursday with no reservation and surprisingly had no wait! \\n\\nMy friend recommend this place and we got an assortment of her favorites. We ordered the fried soft shell crab, dolsot al bap, scallop diy gimbap, seafood butter-gui, and the seafood japchae to share for 3 and it was a good amount. \\n\\nEvery dish was very flavorful and unique. I was really surprised with how much I liked everything and it was really hard for me to compare. The dolsot al bap was served in a hot stone, so you get a nice texture on the rice. Mixed with the cream, it was amazing. The seafood japchae was unique and surprisingly buttery. I'd usually think of japchae as more lighter dish, but this was a lot more heavy and savory. Everything else was what you'd expect, but more. \\n\\nWe also got the corn creme brulee for desert and it was delicious. Don't get scared by the corn; it's not overwhelmingly corn and still a sweet treat!\\n\\nCannot recommend this place more and definitely will come back.\", 'Ariari is a Jeju inspired modern Korean spot in the East Village. Their diy scallop gimbap toll was the standout dish for me. If you can eat beef tartare, that appetizer was not bad - it was unique and one of a kind.  Their other offerings are also elevated and pretty good! On a cold day, the fish stew definitely warmed my party up. \\n\\nDefinitely book reservations beforehand if you are looking to try their food. Great spot for a date or a friend hangout.', 'Cane with no expectations and walked out with a big smile!. First and foremost, I am super hard to be pleased. The food was on point and service was attentive and not overwhelming. Not even one dish that I dislike which is rare. Definitely a casual ambience and may be too loud for a cozy date.', 'I feel lucky we were able to get a reservation at one of the \"toughest tables to book\" in Manhattan right now! It was definitely a fun spot and the food was good.', \"Love the food here at Ariari. During my first visit, I had the scallop DIY, fried chicken, glazed jang-eo and the beef soo yook. Everything was delicious and staff was super friendly and attentive. My favorite was the scallop DIY. You can taste the freshness of the scallops and it's always fun doing your own gimbap.\\n\\nMy most recent visit included unlimited kimchi , fried chicken (again!), seafood butter gui, spicy duck bulgogi, spicy fish stew and the dolsot al-bap. My favorite among the dishes was the dolsot al-bap. The rice was savory with a bit of crunch from the claypot. The fried chicken was fried perfectly, light and crispy, but lacking a bit of flavor this time around. The fish in the fish stew was soft and tender, it was a nice addition to NYC's cold winter. \\n\\nI loved my first visit more; I felt the food during my second visit was just slightly above average. Despite that, service both times have been amazing.\", \"I came here with a party of 3 for an early dinner . Be sure to make a reservation because the place got packed very quickly! There are generally tables of 2 and 4 so I'm not sure how a large party will fit in. I loved the decor inside as well. \\n\\nWe started off with a few drinks which were all great. I love the Korean influence on the cocktails. \\n\\nThe food was also amazing! As a Korean, I approve :) \\n- the complimentary kimchi was amazing!!! I love the fresh crunchy style of kimchi (겉절이)\\n- dolsot al-bap- we love a table side mini show. The taste was great too. I wish the portion were a bit larger \\n- seafood pancake - awesome crunch and super tasty \\n- duck bulgogi - I wish they gave some lettuce with this so I could eat it as a ssam! I thought it was a bit salty but great flavor \\n- spicy fish stew - I don't see many restaurants  serving this and so I was very excited to order. It did not disappoint! It was such a satisfying flavor. The broth was so savory and spicy and delicious \\n\\nOverall I would come here again! I would love to bring my dad who is from Busan\", 'Got lucky with a same-day reservation and had an awesome dinner here. My boyfriend and I shared:\\n\\n+ Fried soft shell crab\\n+ Glazed jang-eo\\n+ Salmon hoe hookah\\n+ Hap-Cheon pork soup\\n+ Omija bingsoo\\n\\nThe highlight was the fried crab, followed by the jang-eo. Everything was great, though!', \"They only open for dinner which kinda requires you to make reservation for groups. We made reservations for 5pm their opening time on Friday. It was full, but there were tables for 2 available. So definitely make a reservation if you would like to visit with 3 or more guests or you might have a wait as the restaurant is small. \\n\\nThe service was amazing. But the food was not up to my expectations. It was good but not what I expected for the small share size dishes that you get for the price. Nothing stood out to me as amazing and I don't think I'd visit again or say this is a must come food spot. All in all, a mid food spot with great service.\", \"It's been almost a year and I was super excited to eat here. My favorite dish is hwe gooksu. The salmon and the noodles in the sauce is flavorful and refreshing. The cabbage salad, a free appetizer is really good. It goes with everything. The dolsot al bap was a bit more fishy than we what we remembered, but it was still good. We also had the spicy fish stew. It was perfect because we've been out in the rain and dealing with ac blasting venues. Soju & beer complimented the dishes. Service was impeccable and I look forward to coming back in the future to try other dishes.\", 'I loveeee ARIARI! The vibes, food, and service are always amazing every time I come. I love bringing visitors because it is a great way to try a lot of different dishes and they all always end up loving it also! They have very unique dishes that are Busan styled. You definitely have to make a reservation because it is always so busy, but I would say it is not too difficult to snag a resy here. I have tried their scallop DIY gimbap, the yook-hoe, the soft shelled crab, mak-hwe, soy braised lotus root salad and dolsot al-bap. The dolsot al-bap is super creamy and flavorful. They mix it in front of you and the waiter always asks if we want to take a picture before which is very funny. My favorites are definitely the soft shelled crab and yook-hoe, so I would highly recommend getting these two dishes for sure. They also give a complimentary salad at the beginning of the meal that I always enjoy.', 'Our group of four dined at ARIARI, sampling a variety of their signature dishes. The waiter provided excellent service--attentive and informative. Despite the intimate setting with closely arranged tables, the ambiance remained relatively quiet.\\n\\nRegarding the food, it was enjoyable overall, but none of the dishes truly stood out. The notable drawback was the portion sizes, notably the 6\" pancake priced at $16, which felt disproportionately small.\\n\\nIn summary, the experience at ARIARI was good, and I\\'m glad I\\'ve go try it out. However, probably won\\'t be returning anytime soon.', \"I got a last minute reservation for four on a Monday at around 7ish. \\n\\nThe place was small and cozy with blaring music. I can't quite say the music was a plus as I could not even recall what type of music was playing. I just remember it being so loud for no good reason.  Definitely not a good place for an intimate dinner or for dates. \\n\\nThankfully, the food and the service were fantastic.\\n\\nWe loved the soy braised lotus root salad, the octopus sook-hoe, and the yook hoe. The serving portions were much smaller than the photos let you believe, but the flavors were so on point that I could forgive the smaller portion sizes. \\n\\nThe seafood pancake was wetter/not as crispy as I would like. Since we were so full from all that we ordered, I think we would skip this next time. \\n\\nThe fried chicken and the soft shell crabs were expertly fried with a different type of flour given I was not used to the texture. They were both favorites.\\n\\nThe seafood jap chae had good flavors, but the noodles congealed so I would skip this too. \\n\\nThe dolsot al bap with uni was so unique and so comforting while the beef su-yuk was just ok. \\n\\nEven though we were god awfully full, we decided to get the corn creme brulee, which really ended our dinner on a super high note. \\n\\nI would come back for the yook hoe, the fried soft shell crabs, the dolsot al bap and the corn creme brulee. \\n\\nDefinitely at least a 4.5 stars and given the great service, I'm bumping it to a 5/5.\", \"Truly a highlight of my trip to NYC.

We were immediately served a side dish of their homemade coleslaw-style kimchi, which ended up being my FAVORITE food item (lol). Serving sizes of their menu items are definitely a little small for how much you're paying, but the food was so good that I thought it was worth the splurge-- we ordered 3 items between the two of us but could've eaten more. My favorite was the glazed eel!\", \"My friend and I came here for an early evening dinner with a reservation. Definitely recommend making one!! They have set times so once your time is up, they have a new group of people coming. \\n\\nIt was both our first times here and they recommended we each ordered two dishes. We got yuk-hwe, braised pork cheek, dolsot Al-bap, and hap-cheon pork soup. This was one of my first meals with braces so I ordered the pork soup which was fine but not amazing. I did try the braised pork cheek and the meat was super tender for someone who could barely chew. My friend liked this dish too. The appetizers we got were good and unique. We probably would get the dolsot Al-bap again but not the yuk-hwe. It was interesting to try but honestly wasn't something we loved. \\n\\nWe both agreed that the appetizers were okay but probably would have been okay with one main course. Also this place has two bathrooms which is somewhat surprising given the size and amount of tables they have!\", 'Cute place, small but loud. Great quick service and all the plates came out promptly.\\n\\nI had a apricot cocktail with brown rice which was sweet but well balanced and enjoyable. The starter which was veggies in a shrimp paste sauce was superb, really had great flavor. I ordered the uni dolsot bap with fish eggs. Wow this is everything I ever wanted in this dish. Creamy, salty, rice was perfect 5/5. I also profaned the fried sea eel wow amazing perfect cook and the glaze was super tasty.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the beef soup and seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nI will definitely be back', 'Not your run of the mill Korean eats.  This place boasts coastal cuisine of Busan.  And I must say they had some interesting stuff on the menu.  Pass on the duck bulgogi, it is just ok.  But the fried eel with eggplant?  Shwing!!  Also tried the hamul pajeon (seafood) and I liked that it was a smaller size.  The seafood is very fresh but it did feel like it was a tad undercooked.  Either that or I prefer my seafood dead as hell.  You choose.  I have had better seafood pajeon.  Anyway, the menu had a lot of cool items I would like to try again.  Oh, and the cocktails were bangin.', 'The cocktails are wonderful and the service is super friendly and helpful. While essentially Korean, the food is not entirely traditional Korean. It is Asian fusion with Korean flavors, ingredients and techniques. The restaurant is very modern in style, although a bit small. Ariari is a good value for the money proposition as well. Go with a group so you can taste a wide variety of different dishes.', \"Ariari has a classic Korean pocha vibe where it's always loud and fun with people all around drinking. Made a reservation for solo at 8:45pm on a weekday, the menu on their website has pictures to every dish and drinks which are always helpful.\\n\\nMak-hwe: A\\nIt has white flute fish and red king fish, both were fresh and tasty. Wrapped with lettuce and garlic ssam-jang and cho-jang this dish is delightful.\\n\\nLotus root salad: A-\\nIt has kombu oil which is not in usual dishes I have so it was rather unique, it brought out the taste of the vegetable, the lotus root was nicely seasoned and very flavorful.\\n\\nEel and eggplant: A-\\nThe description of this dish said it should have some raspberry flavor but I didn't taste that, it's wasn't too saucy, but it got a heavy fish flavor, there were many pieces of eel.\\n\\nPork Soup: B+\\nHmm probably I'm just not used to that aroma or flavor or both? But I think it was kind of a unique pork flavor that made this dish stood out in a unique way, there wasn't much seasoning to the meat itself, it was quite plain, but not bland. A lot of hot spices were added and it matched well with generous amount of chives added.\\n\\nAriari definitely got some unique items on the menu, this place would become one of those I would suggest to my friends whenever we want to have some soju plus alcohol pairing dishes!\", \"Definitely a solid 4/5 stars for the food! It's pretty small inside, and they have an outdoor dining enclosed space too that's where the actual street/parking is. That setup kinda sucks for the waiters though because they have to walk through everyone in the streets to get to the outdoor dining space.\\n\\nBut service was seriously impeccable - the staff are stationed, it seems, like every corner so they're always there if you need anything. We got our waters poured for us almost every time we drank, we had plates cleared immediately to make space for the next ones (but they left the sauces for us), and they even helped me wiped my table after a few dishes as they noticed I was taking a lot of pictures. \\n\\nIn terms of food, it did live up to the hype for the most part, but I'd say that the one dish that got the most hype turned out to be the most underwhelming one. Yep, that's the dolsot al-bap, which is the fish roe/sea urchin cream that gets mixed into the rice, tableside. I'll get to that later. Let's start with the best:\\n\\nFried Soft Shell Crab $18: it's two crabs cut into halves, so four pieces. I'm used to, and love, the salt and pepper soft shell crabs at Chinese restaurants and order it all the time. But Ariari really wowed me with how they did this! It's so simple, but the batter is insanely crispy and light, and it all holds together. Fresh crab, seasoned well, pairs deliciously with the aioli that they serve this with. I just loveee the coating of this. It does get greasy, so one or two pieces per person is more than enough. The waiter was just as shocked when I said that this was my favorite dish of the night haha.\\n\\nI initially wasn't even about to order this dish as I had my eyes set on the lamb stuffed peppers, but they didn't have that available that night so the crab was a replacement. DEF meant to be. Order this!\\n\\nYook Hoe $15: this is the beef tartare with baby octopus. This dish has the most flavor and was soo creamy. A must order again for me if I come back with friends. The texture of the octopus was especially good, I felt like they gave even more octopus than beef. Doesn't matter, the combination of the meat, seafood, and fried onions was perfect. \\n\\nScallop DIY Gimbap: While the scallop was fresh and everything went well together, I think this was definitely quite pricey for the portion. Beautiful presentation, tastes good, but the scallop was sliced so thinly that it was probably just one or two whole scallops at most put together. I made hand rolls out of this, but I also added the yook hoe to make the rolls bigger/packed. This one I would say is a bit hard to share, unless you don't mind each roll only have a tiny sliver of scallop. I don't think this is really worth it exactly, it wouldn't even cost as much at an omakase. Still delish, nonetheless. \\n\\nSquid and Pork: actually very generous with the pork here! Flavorful, sweet, a bit spicy. It's good, just not unique\\n\\nDolsot Al-Bap $19: here comes the dish that I've been seeing all the videos about! Unfortunately, I hyped myself too much? I was expecting something with more umami and the rice to be a lot creamier. But it was on the drier side for a rice dish. I didn't taste too much of the fish roe flavors, it was more of a seaweed mixed rice. It was still fine, just not as good as I thought it would be. It needed more salt at the very least.\", 'I was really excited to check out Ariari after hearing a lot of hype about it. I went with my cousin recently and both of us thought that it was only OK. This is coming from two Korean Americans.\\n\\nThe food here is supposed to be a nod to Busan, the second largest city of Korea, which is especially known for fresh seafood. Therefore, the menu is appropriately heavily seafood focused.\\n\\nWe tried the Mak-hoe, fried soft-shell crab, duck bulgogi, and dolsot al-bap. The mak-hoe is thinly sliced raw fish served with the standard accompaniments including lettuce wraps and ssam-jang. This was overall a nice start to the meal. They gave us two types of fish and both were really fresh, although at nearly $30 it was definitely overpriced. The fried soft-shell crab batter was way too thick and greasy. I could barely taste the crab since all I got was oil. The duck bulgogi tasted good but was texturally off. The beauty of duck is in the crispy skin and this failed on that account. The most popular item seems to be the dolsot al-bap but my cousin and I both thought that this looked better than it tasted. It was fine; however, the flavor was mostly one-note and overall lacked seasoning. We spent $17 to add-on fresh uni and even the uni was not able to really elevate the dish. \\n\\nOverall, I was a bit disappointed in the food but am willing to try it out again. I will say that the service was friendly and attentive, and I liked the casual vibes of the restaurant.', \"They say this place is the spot to go for a taste of Busan, but it felt a bit more fusion/catered to the general public for me. I had to book a reservation in advance, and left questioning what the whole hype was about with this place..\\n\\nThere is definitely a cute decor with throwback Korean music. However, I felt that it was just too loud here to eat comfortably. Whenever new customers came, all the workers yell a welcome saying, but it happened way too frequently. The space is also pretty small and you're pretty close to other tables so it was just so loud.\\n\\nThe foods were okay, but didn't taste as authentic/like home. I came here thinking I'd get food like something I could get in Busan.. \\n\\nThe service was good as they were speedy and were attentive, but overall it was okay and I don't think there needs to be a hype about this place. The famous Dolsot Al Bap was pretty good, with its creaminess and savory kick, but not impressive enough to be waiting like two months to get a reservation here.\", 'I had heard a lot about Ariari and finally got the chance to visit. The experience was absolutely worth the anticipation. This charming restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\nThe staff were attentive and provided great recommendations based on our preferences. We started with the beef tartare and the soft shell crabs. The beef was tender and flavorful. The soft shell crabs were a standout--perfectly crispy on the outside yet succulent inside.\\n\\nAlthough the reservation time was limited to 1.5 hours, the staff managed the timing perfectly, allowing us to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed. The overall ambiance of Ariari, combined with its delicious food and excellent service, made for a really great dining experience!']}, {'id': 'XRjeE9yFANgsG12FWUOoXg', 'name': 'Gair', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bsH1JJFox_2tZNpmqqr1jQ/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://www.gair-dumbo.com', 'display_address': '41 Washington St', 'display_phone': '(718) 233-2595', 'rating': 5.0, 'reviews': [\"5 stars for:\\n\\nAmbiance\\nFood\\nDrinks\\nService\\n\\nBonus points for the lovely smell the moment you walk in.

The chili chicken sando is a must try, so juicy with a nice fragrant spice that doesn't over power. The cornbread was good, pro tip ask for the honey on the side as I felt like it was too much when they did it. One thing is they are always out of the mash and I wanted to try it so bad.

It tastes just like those salted duck egg chips you can get at the Asian grocery stores. The chicken is pretty hefty and juicy, and the crust was quite thick.

We came here on a weekday (Monday) at 6pm + it was a bit slow (only 2 staff, 1 took orders + 1 brought you the food items). So if you are in a rush to go somewhere (like a concert at Barclay's) then this may not be ideal. Ordering was very easy (you order at the register next to the door) + they give you a numbered stand if you dine in. There were a few tables w/ chairs for indoor dining. Love that they have a water dispenser (sparkling or still water) to choose from. There is even a box of gloves for those who don't want to dirty their hands. Tons of wipes were also available.\\n\\nWe ordered to share: 1) 2 piece chili chicken meal w/ 1 side (we chose the cheddar cornbread w/ apple honey),  2) Chili Chicken Sando, 3) Watermelon drink.\\n\\n2 piece chili chicken meal - WOOOOW! I had no expectations and was utterly surprised at how delicious the chili chicken pieces were! The thigh was so soft and meaty & soooo crunchy + nicely seasoned. The breast was also soft but not as soft as the thigh + it was super meat & crunchy + nicely seasoned. The chili oil & spice they put on the outside was not severely spicy but it had a very nice kick to it. So much flavors going on in these chickens! Super delicious & I would reorder this meal again. The side we chose was the cheddar cornbread w/ apple honey + it was so soft, delicious, flavorful w/ the right amount of sweetness. I felt like I was eating a cake haha. \\n\\nChili Chicken Sando (duck fat chili oil, kewpie mayo, bread and butter pickles, milk bread) - WOOWWW! I loveed this sando so much! The milk bread was so soft + fluffy. The chili chicken piece was so meaty and well seasoned + crunchy. That pickle + kewpie mayo paired so well + elevated the sando. I would reorder this in a heartbeat! YUM!!\\n\\nWatermelon drink - this was very light and not very sweet.

The potato salad wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. The same could be said about the cornbread. And then there was the salted egg chicken.

The 2 pcs Fried Chicken for $19.99 is very expensive even if it comes with a side. The salted egg flavor also wasn't that flavorful. I was honestly quite disappointed and wished I spent my money elsewhere. I ended up using my leftover Chick-fil-A sauce for my chicken because the salted egg yolk was really lacking. Where the heck is the hype for this place coming from?\", \"I had the pleasure of visiting Pecking House recently, and I must say, their fried chicken completely exceeded my expectations. The Chili Fried Chicken, with its distinctive seasoning of Sichuan peppercorns and Tianjin chilis, was the star of the meal. It brought a perfect balance of heat and flavor--spicy yet aromatic, with just the right amount of kick to keep you coming back for more. The crispy golden-brown coating was an absolute delight, adding that satisfying crunch with each bite. Meanwhile, the chicken itself was incredibly juicy and tender, making for a deliciously indulgent experience. Every element of the dish was thoughtfully prepared, and it truly made for a memorable meal. If you're a fan of fried chicken with bold flavors, Pecking House is definitely a place to visit!\", \"This place opened after I moved out of the neighborhood. After having grown up in the south, I was really curious to see what the fusion of southern and Chinese cuisine would taste like. \\n\\nWhen I first walked in, Ic couldn't help but notice the cute decor with cartoon chickens painted everywhere. This is a casual, self-service spot where you order at the counter first and then sit at an available table.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the three piece meal with the chili sauce and chose dirty rice and the turnips as our sides. Our food came out relatively quickly and we both enjoyed the Sichuan spice rub with a hint of sweetness to it. It's a comforting flavor to me and not too spicy. The dirty rice paired with the fried chicken really well, although I wasn't a big fan of the turnips. They tasted like thick pieces of potatoes to me and didn't seem to go well with the rest of the food. \\n\\nThey also have a variety of beers that probably go really well with the fried chicken, and they also offer complimentary still AND sparking water (self service) next to the napkins and utensils.\\n\\nI'll definitely be stopping by again!\", \"Great food and a chill vibes. It's order upfront and find a spot to sit, I really liked the casual vibes. I got the pecking chicken sammie (w/foie gras) and had the two spicey two piece chicken with the cauliflower rice.

I'd probably skip the add on next time as it was a great sammie by it self.\\n\\nThe two piece chicken was huge, again with the perfect crunch and spice.

I'm a self-proclaimed fried chicken connoisseur but rarely do I see Taiwanese chicken spots in NYC (aside from the ones at boba shops). The 3pc Chicken Meal is great for sharing as the chicken pieces are huge and they absolutely did not leave a single centimeter of the chicken untouched by the chili flavor. It was a bit too overwhelming and greasy for me personally. The chili flavor was smoky, spicy, and even a little earthy. The only issue is I couldn't taste much else; the chicken was super juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside but that was completely overpowered by the chili. If there's an option to choose the level of chili you want, I would've went with half as much. The sides were a bit confusing as none of them were traditional Taiwanese (to my knowledge) but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! The Heirloom bean salad with sesame was light & fresh and balanced out the spiciness of the chicken. The cheddar cornbread was absolutely delectable; so soft, warm, and buttery and the apple honey is literal crack. I was dunking the cornbread in there. It was unbelievably satisfying! The Chicken Sandwich was the real winner in my eyes! The chicken had that satisfying crunch, it's made with dark meat which was super juicy and tender, and overall it was simple! The flavors of the special sauce, caramelized onions, and soy pickles married together nicely and brought out the best bite every single time. If you come here, that's the item to get! Glad I can now say I've tried Taiwanese Fried Chicken!\", \"I'm [currently] no stranger to fried chicken, and when I heard about Queens born and raised and Eleven Madison Park trained Eric Huang opening this ode to fried chicken, I waited in line along with the rest of legion of fans when he opened this location. I had read about the 10,000 person-long waitlist he had when Pecking House was just a pop-up out of his parent's Chinese restaurant in Queens, but I wasn't a chicken-eater at the time. Having gone back to Pecking House for multiple visits now the place has made me a true fried chicken convert.\\n\\nChef's skills are clear across the menu-- one bite and you can basically taste the Gramercy Tavern and EMP pedigree coming off the chicken, which I tried in both the salted yolk and spicy batter. His spicy batter is signature-- that Sichuan spice rub has so much depth of flavor and is the flavor you should get. If you're a salted egg yolk stan like me, you'll be more than satisfied with the chicken in this flavor.\\n\\nOf course, no chicken meal is complete without the sides-- I love their dirty fried rice, heirloom bean salad, and cheddar cornbread the most. I tried to venture outside the chicken meals and also ordered the mapo tofu sandwich made with yuba, but I'd skip that next time, as well as the wet wings-- they just paled in comparison to the main event and sides.\\n\\nPB dessert is full of great texture from all the crunchies on top of the ice cream, and their affordable prices and casual environment mean I can get my fine dining fix without breaking the bank.\", 'Love this spot for fried chicken and drinks. Its a great location in dowtown brooklyn. Walking inside, the giant marquee menu is helpful and adds a nice ambience through lighting and retro vibes.

Such a fun spot to bring friends visiting', \"Can't believe it's taken us this long to visit Pecking House, despite knowing about since it opened. The raves are well deserved, and they do the fried chicken justice. I was so excited to try the salted duck egg fried chicken and you should've seen me sopping up every last bit of duck egg dusting with the bits of succulent chicken meat. The crisp on the fried chicken skin was perfection. We also really enjoyed the chili chicken sando, which really let the chili oil shine through. I would skip the glazed turnips side dish next time, since it wasn't doing much for me (despite loving turnips) and I would instead  try the dirty fried rice. Loved the cornbread, which was nice and moist, but don't expect it to be too different from an otherwise classic cornbread (aka no Asian element here). \\n\\nWe love how bright and spacious the restaurant is and the cartoon chickens mural on the wall adds a really whimsical touch. You can bet we'll be back! Already dreaming of the salted duck egg fried chicken as I write this...\", 'Following Chef Eric Huang\\'s story, I was SO excited to try Pecking House. But the moment I walked in, everything started going bad.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t feel like the space had IDENTITY. There was a beautiful lit up sign with Chinese characters but then your eyes move over and its this graffiti wall only to have within a few feet, a Chinese takeout menu lightbox with non appetizing pictures of the food. Are we a take out restaurant? Are we a grungy eat with your hands restaurant? Are we a casual nice dining spot? I\\'m not sure.\\n\\nWe made a reservation but the staff completely forgot. So we were pulled together tables and chairs last minute. The restaurant was so unorganized that it was uncomfortable sitting there. People standing around, delivery people walking back and forth to grab their orders, the people sitting at the bar where if we leaned back, our heads would bump their booty. Much like their \"identity\", there was so much going on with NO organization or control.\\n\\nOn to the menu. I wish we could have tried everything but half the menu was SOLD OUT. It was 5:30pm on a Sunday. How is that possible? You didn\\'t JUST open, you\\'ve been open for 2 years.\\n\\nWe all agreed the chicken was a little dry. The sauces for the chicken wings was weird... the only sauce that was OK was the salted egg yolk. The cornbread was not corn bread. The dirty fried rice was plain. Nothing special about some of the other sides.\\n\\nOverall a huge let down.', \"I've heard a lot about this place and was excited to try it out but unfortunately was met with disappointment. First, this is on me as I ordered the tofu sandwich at a chicken shop. It was only after I ordered that I read the reviews on the tofu sandwich here (again, another rookie mistake. I blame myself for this) and realized I made a mistake. There were no great reviews on the sandwich and now I know why. The bread is the only redeeming factor. The sandwich was mainly sauce and the avocado helped in flavor. \\n\\nNow for the chicken - we had the chili spice and salted egg. The crunch factor is there for the salted egg but the flavor was not. The chili crunch flavor was much better but the crunch wasn't there. \\n\\nThe dirty rice was mediocre and the charred cucumbers were not for me. The best part of the whole meal were the fries which were perfectly crispy. \\n\\nWill I come again? Most likely not unless I'm treated to a free meal.\", \"Finally made it out and glad I waited for the hype to wear down a bit. Service was kind, speedy and efficient. Hardly any waitstaff. Filled with utensils, water, gloves and wet maps. The original Sando made with thigh meat added an extra level of flavor. One of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. The garlic and herb quarter chicken was really good. Very flavorful. A bit too much cilantro but nonetheless very juicy. The sauces are the secret menu items that doesn't get enough love. The sauces are pricey but stole the show(truffle & ranch. )The chili has a little dry heat and tingle to it. Not sure I'd  get it again.  The chicken salt fries were really crispy and the chicken salt flavor is perfect. They reheat well in the air fryer too!\", \"Great spot when you're craving fried chicken or a nice yet casual meal.\\n\\nCame here with some friends for a weekend dinner. We split two three piece chickens and order of ghost pepper wings between three people + a beer each. We were left completely stuffed and still had leftover wings-- if I was to go again, I would probably skip one of the items.\\n\\nFor the fried chicken we got the salted egg and chili sauces-- both were really good although I slightly preferred the chili as it felt like it had more depth in flavor. The ghost pepper wings had a spice that built-- if you like hot foods, definitely try it!\\n\\nSides-wise, we got the potato salad, cucumbers, turnips, and cornbread. The sides were honestly all bomb-- you can't go wrong with any of them, so choose based on what dishes you like best.\\n\\nStaff at the restaurant are super friendly. You grab a seat after you order and tables turned over fast enough that no one was ever waiting for a table for too long.\", 'Came back again to try their Chili Crunch Chicken and it absolutely knocked it out of the park. The chicken was crispy, a little numby,full of flava and SO MOIST. As in like, this is one of the few places where I\\'ve had an actual MOIST chicken breast. I basically never get chicken breast personally because no matter how much people usually hype it up, it always ends up being way too dry and tough in my opinion. That\\'s almost why I always stick with dark meat, it\\'s a safer option and even when it\\'s messed up, it\\'s usually at least not dry as all hell. \\n\\nThis place though, the chicken breast is genuinely super juicy and flavorful, and is one of the few places where I\\'d go back and get it again. Seriously, props on the chicken breast. The sides I got this time were dirty fried rice and cauliflower gratin and while the fried rice definitely could have been \"dirtier\" the cauliflower gratin was cheesey and just hit that spot perfectly. \\n\\nService was nice as well and they do mention that there is a $2 upcharge if you get either all white meat or all dark meat so take that into consideration. I\\'d opt for a breast,thigh, and leg for the 3 piece meal. I definitely didn\\'t regret getting it this time! I\\'ll be back sometime for sure!', \"The countless Instagram reels that are circulating around is what brought us in one afternoon to get 2 Spicy Chicken Sandwiches, officially on the menu as PICANTE CHICKEN SANDWICHES. Straightforward ordering, none of the sides seemed tempting enough to order any of them. Order was ready in no time. \\n\\nWe couldn't wait to get home to try these bad boys. The brioche bun was soft and lightly toasted. The Fuqi chili sauce and pickled jalapeños are the only sources of spice and heat in the sandwich; none of which even raised the temperature of palate. The chicken is marvelously crunchy and moist but not spicy at all. The Oaxaca cheese saved the sandwich for me.\\n\\nI'm one and done on Pecking House.\", \"I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't good and the chicken was pink on the inside too so I definitely would've gotten food poisoning if I ate it. I've definitely had better sichuan fried chicken. The cornbread was good though\", 'Lot of hype for this place but unfortunately did not live up to the hype. Chicken was lacking flavor and mine was served slightly undercooked. Lots of better spots in the city for fried chicken.', \"I first had Pecking House when it was a pop-up with a crazy waitlist during the pandemic, and I'm so glad they now have a brick-and-mortar! Thankfully, it seems like the hype has died down as the place was pretty empty when I came on a weekday afernoon.\\n\\nThis place is worth the trek! I got the chicken sandwich and the chili chicken sando to share, and the chicken was unbelievably moist and juicy in both sandwiches. The spice in the chili chicken sandwich was pretty tolerable, and that's coming from someone who can't handle any spice at all. It was mostly spicy from the chili oil with a little bit of that numbing spice. The milk bread was so soft and soaked up some of the sauce from the chicken. I do think the regular chicken sandwich was my favorite though. The soy pickles were a nice touch, and the brioche was a perfect bread for the sandwich.\\n\\nI wish I had a bigger stomach so I could also try the salted egg fried chicken, but this meal was so filling. Next time!\", \"It's been a while since I've had a unique fried chicken experience especially given how popular Korean fried chicken and American fried chicken places are. Pecking house servers more Taiwanese/Chinese style fried chicken flavors, especially the salted egg yolk one.\\n\\nI opted for the meal set that came with 2 pieces and a side - choosing the salted egg yolk and chili flavors with green garlic ranch alongside the grilled cucumber salad. While the chicken was crispy and juicy, the cucumber salad was a little disappointing so I would definitely recommend a different side.\\n\\nThis place is definitely worth trying if your a fan of fried chicken!\", 'This restaurant has been popping up on my tiktok as having some of the best Chinese  fried chicken in Brooklyn, very happy I got to check it out! \\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant, it was clean & inviting. The service was fast and courteous. There is a sign up front letting you know to place your order at the counter then have a seat \\n\\nSince this was my 1st visit, I opt to try the 2 piece chili chicken meal that came with 1 side- I chose the cheddar corn bread with apple honey ($18) + a side of green garlic ranch ($2) \\n\\nThe chicken was fried perfectly. The skin was crispy and the inside was juicy. Definitely happy we got the garlic ranch - it helped compliment the spices on the chili chicken \\n\\nThey also sell sandwiches, beer & wine- will definitely try a chicken sando next visit!', \"I've been wanting to try this place for over a year. Perhaps it was the anticipation, but the experience was a let-down. We did 2 orders of 2 pieces and one seasonal side, and it costed over $40. The dirty fried rice was good but very flavorful, and the cornbread was pretty decent. The chicken was crispy and juicy, but lacked in flavor. I see the attempt, but I don't think it was well executed.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say this place is overrated.\", \"This place serves up chicken in a variety of ways, with an Asian twist. I appreciated how they had flavors like salted egg, which was pretty unique. The restaurant has been hyped up so much by social media and my friends so I was excited to try it. From the name, I kind of assumed they would have more Chinese dishes, but it's heavily revolved around chicken and southern cuisine. \\n\\nThe place itself is gorgeous and nicely decorated. I've always walked past it on the outside and assumed it was a proper restaurant, but it's actually a more casual, fast food vibe. You order at the register in the front and they bring you the food to your table. You also have to get your own water and busk your table at the end. I was surprised that they heavily pushed for a tip, even having a sign next to where you pay advocating for it. \\n\\nI got the 2 piece chicken meal with the salted egg flavor with the cornbread side. For $18 this is pretty expensive, as the chicken pieces skewed on the smaller side. We also tried the potato salad and cauliflower sides. \\n\\nThe chicken itself is solid, but didn't wow me. I was expecting more from the salted egg flavor, but it didn't really pop to me. The chicken was juicy, I just wished it was a big bigger. The cornbread was ok, it came with honey on the side, but still was pretty dry and crumbly. The potato salad tasted as expected. The cauliflower, however, was my favorite by far. It came cooked in cheese and topped with breadcrumbs. I loved how creamy it was and it complimented the chicken perfectly. \\n\\nOverall, I'm glad I tried Pecking House, but I doubt I will come back. There's far better chicken places in the area, that are also more affordable considering the casual environment.\", 'Really cute spot with a friendly service .\\nA good menu small and to the point.\\nPersonally I think the chicken itself could have had a bit more flavor, but was very crunchy ! Also did not really care for the bun. But I am giving three start because their soy sauce pickles blew my mind and everyone so go try them so freaking good I could eat a whole jar !', \"The chicken chili on milk bread was one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had in my life.

I got the sloppy po tofu sandwich and my husband got the chicken pieces. Personally, the reason it gets a 4 is because the sloppy po made the bread too soggy for my liking so it changed the taste a bit and made the eating experience super messy.', \"In this second visit, our 3:45 pm 2-piece chili fried chicken meal wasn't as spectacular as our memory from when they first opened.\\nThe fried chicken is still really, really good. The glistening crispy coating drowning in a mala chili oil is a thrilling experience. The flavors are loud, heart-pounding. Our bone-in breast was--gasp--a little dry!\\nThe bigger letdown was the butterbean salad side. I remember it being excellent, lively with toasted sesame coating big creamy white- and black-colored beans. This time, the black beans were pedestrian regular-seeming black beans, and the sauce was more soy than sesame. The way we put it, Pecking House is good but not good enough for a special trip out to Brooklyn. \\nShoutout to the sparkling water spigot. Carbonation goes well with their chicken.\", \"Long time fan. Recently came here twice within 2 weeks. I'm not a huge fan of Szechuan chili but their fried chicken is amazing. The salted duck one was good but not the best. Definitely wanna get their naked fried chicken next!\\n\\nTheir sides are great too. Must get the cornbread with honey!\", \"Stopped in for lunch after hearing great things about their fried chicken, and I agree. The fried chicken is wonderfully crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I ordered the chili flavor and while it was not for me because I found the chili rather boring, it would not stop me from going back and getting their naked, extra hot, or salted egg flavors. The fried chicken came with one side- I picked the cheddar cornbread. Excellent texture but somewhat weak in flavor. They serve it with honey, which definitely helps. My friend ordered one of the chicken sandwiches and really enjoyed it. \\n\\nFast casual style where you order at the register and they bring the food out to your table. There's also a bar counter with a couple of beers on tap if you want to eat there.\", \"I knew I had to try Pecking House after seeing so many videos online. Walking in, you wouldn't think anything special but man their chicken definitely packs a punch. \\n\\nOur group of 3 shared the Fried Chicken Meal: Chili 3-Piece w/ 2 sides: dirty fried rice & cucumbers ($27) and Spicy Chicken Sando ($16). I'd say the price is fair for the amount of food we got because the pieces of chicken are huge!\\n\\nThe chicken is so moist and tender and has the perfect crunch on the exterior. The chili wasn't too overpowering and the chicken wasn't too salty either. I was really surprised that they were able to get the chicken to be so flavorful and moist throughout even though the pieces are really thick. The sandwich was also very good, but it seemed a little dryer because of the bun. Next time I come, i'd definitely just get the chicken meal vs the sandwich but I think it's worth trying at least once.\\n\\nThe sides I didn't care for that much. The dirty fried rice was pretty bland and wasn't anything special. The cucumbers also weren't very seasoned and didn't have the ginger flavor I was expecting. \\n\\nI would definitely give Pecking House a try if you're in the Brooklyn area and love fried chicken! Service can be a bit slow, but I think it's worth it given how fresh everything is.\", 'Love the fried chickens!  Service is casual and friendly. Ambience is what you expect from a fried chicken and bar.  Just some place you would go whenever you want fried chicken.\\n\\nThe chili oil chicken is perfectly spiced, kicked and after taste. So a must tried.\\n\\nThe side of corn bread was also excellent. Moist and tasty\\n\\nThe salted egg flavor is good, some nostalgia for some of us, but not as intricate as the chili oil. \\n \\nOrange pepper wings is good, a refined version of buffalo wings but save the room for fried chicken.', \"I came in on a Thursday evening, the place was pretty much half empty, with plenty of tables. \\n\\nYou place your order at the front desk and then they give you a number before you choose your own seating. \\n\\nI got the PH chicken sandwich which was $16 and the Orange Pepper Wet Wings for $13. For the portion size of the wings, it's 7 small wings for $13, making it really expensive. \\n\\nThe PH chicken sandwich came with crispy chicken thigh, pickles and some caramelized onion. The first few bites were great, but the chicken didn't really have much flavor. Towards the middle and end, it really didn't feel tasty. There's not enough flavor in the chicken sandwich, making it feel dry. \\n\\nAs for the wet wings... I truly don't know how I feel about the sauce. Besides the portion/wing size, the flavor wasn't hitting the spot for me, it was very soggy hence wet wings, I guess. But it didn't really stand out. Wouldn't pay $13 for these wings again!\", \"Korean fried chicken has been my pick for fried chickens in the past few years, but @pecking_house definitely brings a very interesting twist to the food with popular flavors in Chinese and Taiwanese restaurants such as chili and salted egg.\\n\\nI preferred the salted egg fried chicken because I'm a sucker for all things salted egg!\\n\\nFavorite side dish was actually the corn bread - it was so good and different from the usuals with that apple honey taste!

It is quite difficult to secure a resy but I do think it's well worth it if you can get one. \\nThe vibes are very chill and laidback, not snobby for a Michelin wine bar.\\n\\nWe are not big wine drinkers (I know, it's a wine bar...), but the servers recommended a great light orange/skin contact option, and a non-alcoholic red, which was so good!! I was nervous for the food, because I'm a big look at the menu the night before kind of person, and since their menu changes daily, I couldn't get a preview. But nonetheless, the menu offered good options. We had the salted cod fritters, yellowfin tuna, celery salad, chicken liver mousse & wagyu chuck flap. We also ended with a black sesame panna cotta. I would skip the cod fritters next time, but I would recommend all the other dishes! The celery salad was a standout and so was the wagyu chuck flap. Their portions are on the smaller side which meant we were able to try everything. We felt content but could go for another slice of pizza afterwards.\\n\\nOverall, I truly enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back for dinner to try more! The fact that they change their menu daily and seasonally keeps me interested to come back again.\", \"Unfortunately, I had a lackluster experience at the highly acclaimed The Four Horsemen (summer 2024). We somehow managed to snag a reservation for 3. \\n\\nHouse bread - Yes.\\n\\nOeuf mayonnaise - the black and white swirl presentation was fascinating. However, the hollandaise/mayo sauce overpowered whatever was underneath. The caviar didn't really do anything to add to the dish\\n\\nFried skate wing - just a whole, thin fish without much unique flavor. \\n\\nBerkshire pork loin - this is basically just chashu pork. There wasn't much else to it, no twist or fresh take on anything. The pepper was unpleasant to eat and full of seeds.\\n\\nVeal sweetbread skewers - these were delicious, tender, and flavorful.\\n\\nI know their menu rotates frequently, so maybe this iteration was just off. I'd like to come back and try a different course if the Resy gods allow it.\", \"This review is from June 30, 2024 and I accidentally left my review in draft but posting anyway. Menu items have likely since changed but The Four Horsemen is a favorite of mine!\\n\\nI've been for both lunch and dinner. No matter the meal the food and wine are always delicious! I'd suggest a reservation to ensure you can get a table and don't grab a spot too close to closing because menu items do sell out.  \\n\\nOn this occasion we had a late lunch right before they closed to prep for dinner. We ordered the snap pea salad, poached shrimp, montauk fluke and boudin blanc. Our server we able to suggest wines that went really well with our dishes.\\n\\nUsually service is great but on this date it was a bit difficult to order drinks and food. We also had a bit of a miscommunication or the server didn't hear us but an order for another dish was missed. The server did apologize and even comp'd a round of drinks.

My party of 2 didn't have a reservation, but arrived in line at 5:10 pm and had no issues making their first walk-in seating at 5:30 pm. Upon entrance, the venue is really homie and quaint. The menu changes frequently and they have a large assortment of wines to pair. We started with a couple glasses and had the gnocco fritto, winter chicories, braised leek toast, and butter beans in brodo. All of the dishes were incredible - great flavor and balance.

Didn't have a reservation so walked-in on a Sunday morning and was seated in ~5-10 minutes at the bar. The food here is small-bites, higher price and higher quality but worth it IMO for a Michelin star experience. The gnudi, cod fritters, and fried chicken we ordered were all cooked wonderfully and very high quality. My favorite was definitely the fried chicken, it was crispy and well-seasoned on the outside and super juicy and flavorful on the inside as well. The sun-dried tomato gave it an extra flavor too.\\n\\nThe menu changes everyday so your personal dining experience may depend on what's on the menu that day, but for me personally I had a great experience at Four Horseman and will say it's one of my favorite upscale places to eat in NY.\\n\\nAlso, would definitely recommend making a reservation if you want to be at a table and not the bar, as sometimes I think the wait for the bar can be ~1-2 hours.\", 'Pretty good wine.

The dimly lit interior creates an intimate ambiance, ideal for a cozy gathering or a date night. With seating for about 20 guests, this hip spot practically demands reservations far in advance; our party of six booked ours three months ahead. The line of eager patrons waiting to experience The Four Horsemen is a testament to the quality and depth of its food and wine offerings.\\n\\nService here is attentive and polished, reminiscent of classic Michelin-starred standards, from neatly folded napkins when you step away to impeccable timing and expert wine pairings. Our meal was served family-style, with our party of six sharing a nine-course feast. Standout dishes included the chilled mussels with gazpacho and basil, and the Oeuf mayonnaise topped with caviar. The latter was particularly unique, featuring an \"egg on egg\" concept with a hint of salinity from squid ink, resulting in a truly memorable bite. \\n\\nFor wines, we enjoyed an orange wine, a Riesling, and a red, all thoughtfully paired and refreshingly balanced--not overly sweet, which was a welcome change from the sweeter offerings often found elsewhere. The Four Horsemen is definitely worth a visit, but be sure to secure your reservation well in advance.', \"I absolutely loved this place. The service left something to be desired but the food and wine completely made up for it and made me forget! It took me months to get a reservation and I considered just showing up when it opened one day and walking in. We got a reservation for a Thursday at 5:30 pm for a group of 3 as soon as they opened and when I got there, there was already a line down the street. If I didn't have a reservation I don't know how long it would've taken to get in.\\n\\nI believe their menu changes often but we ordered The Oeuf Mayonnaise, Short Rib, and Mussels. We ended up getting a second order of the short rib because it was THAT good.\", \"On a recent trip to NYC, The Four Horsemen was at the top of our list. My boyfriend had already been and claimed this to be his all time favorite restaurant in the city. I had high expectations and needless to say, I was blown away. \\n\\nWe walked in with no reservation on a Monday night knowing that there would be a wait. We were quoted about a 3.5 hour wait and got on the waitlist. About an hour later, we got a text that our table was ready and we had 10 minutes to show up to claim it. It was a good thing we only ventured just down the street because we sped walked back as soon as we could!\\n\\nWe were seated at the bar with the perfect view of the small intimate dining room, the talented bartenders, and the tiny kitchen with focused chefs. We ordered multiple dishes including a mixed salad, sourdough bread with the most amazing browned butter I've ever had, sesame seed yellowfin tuna, squid with pepperoncinis, pork loin, and a panna cotta/flan type (?) dessert. Along with so, so much wine. \\n\\nIt might seem strange but the sourdough and browned butter was honestly one of the highlights of the meal. I still think about it. The tuna was perfectly cooked as was the squid. The squid paired surprisingly well with the pepperoncinis, a pairing I never thought of before but just makes so much sense now, and the pork loin was to die for. You best believe we gnawed on the bone, it was that good. \\n\\nThe staff was incredible throughout. Recommending one amazing natural wine after the next. Their generosity and hospitality along with the absolute culinary masterpieces that rotate daily on the menu is why this place has a Michelin star (and actually deserves to keep it).\", \"We loved The Four Horsemen! 4.5 stars. Excellent food and service. The only sour note was having to wait 45 minutes at the wine bar next door to be seated. We didn't mind relaxing there with a drink, and I'd like to come back just for the bar.\\n\\nFood: 5 stars. The oeuf mayonnaise is beautiful visually and is richly tasty, but the Berkshire pork loin was the standout. Sweet and salty with a nice crust and charred peppers. The green tomatoes were tangy and delicious too.\\n\\nService: 5 stars. Our waiter was warm and friendly, and apologetic about the wait. I was worried they would be snooty about the natural wines (they're known for their wine list, we're not knowledgable about wine) but it was just the opposite. We were gently guided on what to order, under zero pretension from our waiter; we felt no pressure to price up and our waiter nailed our preferences with easy to drink, but still interesting, crowd pleasers.\\n\\nAmbiance: 4 stars. Buzzy and a bit tightly seated, but no issues with sound and nice background playlist (but not distracting).\", 'Very cozy, cute spot in Williamsburg. The quality of the food was phenomenal and service was great. Def try the cherry non-alcoholic drink! The restaurant is very small and tight but we had a great brunch experience as a party of 4. Highly recommend the wagyu and the sesame panna cotta. Great for small groups or date night!', 'Mussels and wagyu were standout and remained light despite clean, simple flavors, chicken liver mousse was very solid and matsutake mushroom rice was a slight letdown in terms of price/value.

WOWW ive been meaning to eat here for the past 2 years and i finally got a reservation!!

They have an extensive wine menu but we didnt drink bc we were here for lunch. The best dishes imo were the yellowtail tuna!! It had yuzu (YUM) I also like their olive oil! Everything was homemade even the tart crust and their side of bread.

And if anyone was primed to like a place, I certainly was. So it almost pains me to have to say how bad this was. \\n\\nFirst, it's almost impossible to get a table. Because of the impossible hype this place has generated. So I came practically at opening time and came solo. They told me they didn't have a table but there's a standing room only area where people can actually order food and wine. A few other people were doing this so I decided to give it a try. Perhaps that should have been my warning to walk out right then and there. Because everything went downhill from there. \\n\\nThe service was awful. I had to flag down someone from start to finish. The food was again, a huge disappointment. The appetizer dish that everyone posts about was nearly inedible. The pasta was ok but nothing memorable. The only good thing about the entire meal was the wine. \\n\\nIf you're considering this because of the Michelin mention or because they keep showing up on top NY restaurants list, I urge you to reconsider. I literally left feeling like I wasted my time and money and was very disappointed. If I could turn back the clock I would have gone to Wildair instead.\", \"Had quite high expectation before - word of mouth, difficulty of reservation.\\n\\nThe asparagus was quite unique and refreshing! \\nTuna - I personally tasted a little bit of fishy on the tuna (I'm super sensitive to the fishy tastes and my friend thinks it's fine).

It's so talented to combine the fried skate wing with cucumber and cilantro! It's also the first time I've seen a cilantro flower\\nDessert - strawberry with cream.\", 'Place is very cute and our server was solid. It was difficult for us to decide which wine we wanted -our server gladly brought us a taste before we made a decision. We asked him for his recommendations. There were a few things that I had wanted to try from the photos that were not on the dinner menu so just keep that in mind -like the layered potatoe. He recommended the house Bread to start, which was just good freshly baked and very soft. The oeuf mayonnaise was good melted in your mouth. What he said was the best thing on the menu, the celery salad was actually phenomenal!!!!  well balanced between the figs and the walnuts. I would come back just for this. We had skewers of some type which were outstanding. The waygu was a little too sweet for me and the beans which just tasted like beans nothing to really write home about on that. But the first few dishes were very good. Definitely understand the hype.', \"After many random nights of trying to walk in and get a seat, we finally managed to get one where we had to wait less than 20 minutes on a Wednesday night. \\n\\nWhile we waited, the hostess at the front was super nice and led us back to nightmoves(?) next door for a drink and to now wait in the cold. Before we knew it, our table was ready.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar. It was packed and the vibe is low key pretentious tbh (from guests, not servers) but the food met the high bar.\\n\\n- warm bread (5/5): everything you want bread and butter to be.\\n- yellowfin tuna (5/5): that sesame crust was bomb. Just a great, unique delicious plate.\\n- salad (4.5/5): refreshing, well balanced\\n- the squid (4.5/5): quite the statement dish. This was actually quite large. Perfectly charred. Didn't love the type of peppers that accompanied it but overall a very well prepped dish.\\n- ricotta gnudi (5/5): these were pillows of ricotta and I would definitely order this again. Quite rich.\\n- toffee pudding (5/5): save room for dessert! This was surprisingly delicious. Loved the sweet and salty combo. I found myself spooning every last drop of this.\\n\\nThe only thing I found slightly disappointing was the wine, honestly the ones tried were good but considering they are known for its wine, I didn't really find the ones I tried too interesting.\\n\\nWas it worth the wait and effort to come dine here? I gotta say that it was. The food was just very solid and the ambiance felt like I was in someone's home. Next time, as hard as it can be, I'll try to make a reservation ahead of time or come again during an off hour.\", \"I couldn't get reservations so I just walked in and was able to get a spot. The food was delicious and wonderfully plated. Service was great too - food came out pretty quickly\\n\\nFood:\\nMonkfish - delicious with citrus \\nOeuf mayonnaise with caviar - delicious \\nSquid with pickled peppers - delicious \\nMushroom with gnudi - ok\\nSticky toffee pudding - was a bit too sweet for me but it was good\", \"This is one of the few Michelin star restaurants in Brooklyn and it was an excellent night dining here.  We had to get reservations about a month in advance.  You have to wake up and snag a slot as soon as reservations open up at 7 a.m.  They get snatched up within seconds of them coming online.\\n\\nInside the restaurant, the dining area feels confined, but they have tables that seat parties of 4-6 or a party of 2.  The area was artsy and the audio quality of the music was coming out cleanly to complement overall vibe. \\n\\nNow.  Let's talk about the food.\\n\\nWaiter recommended that we get about 5-6 items off the menu, so we did just that.  The Gnocco Fitto is a savory beignet with prosciutto on top.  Escarole salad was nutty and nicely dressed.  I will rave about the yellowfin tuna: it's seared on the top, almost like a baked crust with sesame seeds liberally sprinkled across.  It sat on a puddle of brown butter, which took the flavor and taste to new heights.  If you can't tell by now, I loved it.  I would recommend you get this dish. \\n\\nThe Dungeness crab was great; albeit, a little too small portion for my liking.  This is a soup within the crab's body shell.  I enjoyed the seasoning and it had a smoky accent in the flavor.\\n\\nService was top notch and what you can expect from a Michelin star restaurant.\\n\\nI loved this experience and would absolutely come back!\", 'Came here for a friend\\'s birthday with high expectations. Unfortunately, the prices were absolutely outrageous. Because of our party size of six we were forced to take a pre-fix lunch menu which I anticipated being an individualized pre-fix for each person. This was not the case as we were instead forced to split two \"family style\" servings of the dishes for six people. \\n\\nThe highlights of this was splitting half of a sourdough bread three ways. Also, rather than give a portion of wagyu to each person that also needed to be rationed off because we only received four small pieces.\\n\\nWhile the taste of the food was very good, this did not in the slightest make up for the cost. The fact that this place is advertised on yelp as a moderately priced restaurant is complete false advertisement and should be adjusted accordingly.\\n\\nPossibly if you aren\\'t forced into a pre-fix menu the prices would be more acceptable but I fully would discourage anyone from the pre-fix menu as it is a total ripoff.', \"I've been dying to come here for a couple months, so I was super excited when one of my friends managed to snag a lunch reservation. The inside of the restaurant is cozy and warmly lit. There aren't many seats, and it filled up immediately upon opening.\\n\\nWe ordered a few things to share, including the celery salad with dates, walnuts, and cheese; the beef tartare on toast; the boudin blanc (sausage), served with prunes, mashed potatoes, and concentrated chicken stick; and the rum baba, served with vanilla cream. All of it was delicious. \\n\\nAll the staff were so nice and hospitable (ex.: folding your napkin for you if you step away from your seat; replacing dirty plates/cutlery between dishes). \\n\\nIf you're willing to spend a little extra for a nice meal, I'd recommend coming here.\", \"We wallked in without reso during weekend dinner and got high top seating facing the windows. Food was pretty good but it felt cramped and pricey. Even with a table reso I think we would have felt similarly. Good to try but don't think we'd return\", \"this place needs to be on your list. it's simple yet complex, delicious yet not overpowering - the perf balance.\\n\\nthe food: i got the snap pea salad, skate wing, grilled squid, and potato sausage in curry sauce. everything was delish but i cannot get over how amazing the sauce the skate wing's were soaked in - it's creamy and savory, but also light?? crazy. \\n\\nthe drinks: got a glass of skin contact, beaut!\\n\\nthe space: small yet cozy\\n\\nthe service: attentive!\", 'I had a decent experience but overall this just missed the mark after factoring in the cost. My friend and I scored a last minute reservation for brunch and shared five plates. A few of them were special, but the rest left something to be desired.\\n\\nCurried Egg - my favorite, something I haven\\'t encountered before that looks rather plain in the photo but has so many flavors that marry with the egg beautifully. For $18, by far the most I\\'ve coughed up for an egg\\nBeef Tartare - pretty average, but with a hint of horseradish that I didn\\'t like\\nScallop - ONE scallop in a creamy garlicky sauce, with julienned daikon on top. Delicious, but really tiny and we couldn\\'t stop laughing at how expensive it was ($26)\\nBeef Tendon - sliced extremely thinly and served in too small of a portion, and the flavor was pretty one dimensional of citrus. Beef tendon is typically a \"leftover\", less valuable part of the cow and seems especially overpriced in this case\\nOysters - my friend\\'s favorite. Fresh, and the \"ocean\" taste was mellowed out by the \"salsa\" on top\\n\\nWe weren\\'t in the mood for day drinking and thus missed out on the wine offerings that this restaurant is known for. But we did see several customers doing boozy brunch. \\n\\nGenerally, the plates we ordered ranged from ok to terrific, and we felt one or two were worth the price. Service was attentive, explaining the menu to us and clearing our table quickly to make way for the next dish. However, the space itself was pretty tight, and since we were at a table in the middle of foot traffic, waiters bumped my elbows moving about the room. The overall bill post-tax and tip was about $150, and we hopped to a cafe after since we were still hungry. This place is most likely a one-time visit for me, but the menu does continually change so never say never.', \"This review is for weekend lunch. Was able to get a last minute reservation for two likely due to cancellations from bad weather. I know this place has a lot of hype. Did it blow my mind? No, but I thought it was very good. Food felt simple (not in a bad way), but well executed - high quality ingredients and good balance of flavors. \\n\\nAmbiance / Service: very small and intimate. Not good or maybe even possible for groups of more than 4. I could see this being a nice date night spot. Service was good. \\n\\nFood: meant to share. The waitress said to order 1-2 dishes PER person, depending on how hungry you are. We got 4 between 2 people and it was perfect. I ordered:\\n\\n-Black Bass: this is ceviche. It's very simple, but refreshing, light, and lemony. \\n\\n-Romaine: again, pretty simple, but well executed. Love how drenched in cheese it was. \\n\\n-Gnocchi Fritto: least favorite, but definitely still good. It really just tasted like a deep fried puff pastry. \\n\\n-Spaghetti: very flavorful!\", 'Food is amazing. Nice sharing plates and delicious. Wine selection is also top notch. Nice ambiance and service. Definitely must visit when your in Williamsburg.', 'Fantastic place for a date! Went here and were able to get in without a rez. We dined on the house bread, spring greens, chickpea crepe, and the spinach pasta topped with burrata! \\n\\nI would totally come here again. The service and atmosphere was A+, as well as the recommendations from the server. The small space makes it a little cramped, but I feel like that just adds to being more friendly and sharing some dishes!', \"Walked in for a table at 5pm on a Sunday and was seated before 7pm! Loved the vibe of the space, and the wines were great. \\n\\nThe food was fresh and every dish tasted thoughtfully prepared with well sourced ingredients. My favorite dish was the tuna which was crusted with sesame seeds, and I also really enjoyed the sea bream served with an incredible citrusy sauce. \\nFor dessert, I got the olive oil cake which was cooked to perfection with notes of fennel, but missed a creamy component to it. Would've been perfect if it was paired with a dollop of whipped or ice cream! \\n\\n- @nyconthetable\", 'My sister and I came without reservations and were able to walk in (they allow this for bar seating) and were able to get a standing spot by the bar right away. Granted it was rainy and it was a Sunday. \\nThey then moved us to a seat by the window which was great. \\nWe ordered the curry eggs and it was delicious. The orange wine was also fantastic!', \"Overall rating: 4.5 \\n\\nEh, I don't know if this spot is for me. I had very high expectations & I've been wanting to go here for at least 4 years. I knew how elusive it was because I felt like it took forever to get a reservation. After waking up at a specific time, finding the 2nd person, I was able to get one. I was very excited!\\n\\nI think for me, I just wasn't expecting it to be so fish forward. I knew this was fancy but the limited options (very short menu) was a turn off for me. I do know they change menus very frequently and what I had isn't what you are going to have. I understand the factors. \\n\\nBut I think, personally, I was just expecting a little more pizazz for the the price and just how hard it is to get in. The space also felt tight and cramped. The place came highly recommended but it just wasn't for me. If you're a fancy person, you'll definitely like it. But I do recommend giving it a try. I'd like to try again but on a date & a different season.\", \"What an experience! We didn't have a reservation so decided to put ourselves on the waitlist. We were 6th in line and it took about 30-45 minutes to get in. Definitely worth the wait!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is cozy and candlelit. Our server was so friendly and helpful with recommendations for food and pairings of wine to go with it.\\n\\nApologies but I don't remember exactly what kind of fish I ordered - I think it was sea bass but since the menu changes often, idk. It was a really small portion so it was recommended that we order some bread and butter to go with it. That was an excellent recommendation because the bread and butter is the best I've tasted at a restaurant. The attention to detail is impeccable here as the bread was warmed perfectly, with the butter soft enough to spread.\\n\\nMy friend got the chicken which comes in a jus. Look at it, it's got the foot connected with the nails still attached! What a sight when it came to our table. It comes with roasted garlic which you can spread on the chicken or the bread, and you can dip the bread in the jus as well. \\n\\nEverything was delicious from start to finish and I can't wait to go again.\", \"The Four Horsemen has been on my list for the longest time - glad I finally managed to snag a res for lunch (since dinner is hard unless you wanna do 11pm). It's a small place, very cozy. \\n\\nThey're known for having a killer natural wine selection so I knew I had to order a glass. Funky orange wine. Good stuff. \\n\\nThey have a pretty short menu comprised of mostly small plates and larger mains all for sharing. \\n\\n1. Black bass: The fish was a good starter. Zingy and fresh. \\n2. Romaine heart salad: the salad was also pretty good especially with the toasted nuts. \\n3. Pig's head toast was a bit too porky for my taste but that's expected.\\n4. The clams with the saffron broth and the pumpkin was killer. Definitely order some bread on the side with this.\\n5. Spaghetti ala Norma: The pasta came buried underneath all the cheese. The texture was perfectly Al dente. You could feel the craggles and ridges and they perfectly captured the sauce. Good and homey. Nothing super omg different about the flavors but that pasta was superbly made. \\n6. Peach ice cream was probably the let down of this meal. Came buried under all the whipped cream. The ice cream was good (don't get me wrong) but tasted nothing like peaches. Could not really tell what the flavor was if I'm being honest haha probably more tea-ish. \\n\\nOverall, The Four Horsemen is great. My type of restaurant. Would love to come back for dinner since they have a more extensive menu for that. Killer wine list. Small plates. Interesting combos. Nice place to chill with some friends and guzzle down some natty wine.\", \"There is a lot to like here, including the room (nicely sound deadened), the friendly staff and the meal experience, but there's just enough to keep this from being a 5 star stop. \\n\\nThe wine selection is expansive and eclectic (be prepared to hear the words funky, edgy and offbeat in many descriptions), although they'll let you taste anything before you make a final decision, which is very nice. We found multiple glasses to our liking by the end of the evening. \\n\\nThe staff is super friendly and attentive. Never did we have to wonder if our drink or food order was coming, nor did we have to worry about finished items being cleaned away before new items came to the table. \\n\\nThe menu is designed for sharing, organized from smaller portions to larger portions. The standout items for us were all at the top of the menu... the bread is out of this world amazing, and the gnocchi fritter with prosciutto was absolutely divine. The trout, on the other hand, was small and plated with mushrooms that didn't really add anything to the presentation or the taste of the dish, and the pork loin was covered in a sour cherry sauce that hid the impressiveness of the cut. \\n\\nWhile the room does sound very nice early in the evening, there is clearly 8-10 more seats in the restaurant than the acoustics were designed for. When the place is at capacity, it sounds like any other small restaurant. If you get a chance to experience a seating when one table is empty in each of the three rows (very small room), you'll start to appreciate the clear amount of thought that went into the sound dampening.\", 'Amazing experience. The food was great and our server recommended a glass of wine to go with each of our courses. Four Horsemen was a bucket lister restaurant for me, and so happy with the meal, serving, and ambiance.', 'This might be one of the hardest reservations to get at any restaurant in NYC but do not fret! If you show up as soon as they open (or 15 mins before to be safe), they have bar / counter seating that is reserved for walk-ins. \\n\\nThe service is very friendly and welcoming here. I came by myself and ordered three things off the menu, which was honestly more than enough food for me. The bread is a must-order, honestly might be the highlight of the whole meal with the butter!! The yellowfin tuna and swordfish are also incredible as well! The bartenders are knowledgeable on wines as well and can help you find the right pairing for your tastes. Great experience', \"Came for a weekend brunch, very difficult to get a reservation as it's a small space with limited seating. It's intimate, a bit loud, but the food is great, albeit small portions to share amongst a group and pricey but that's expected.\\n\\nLove that their menu changes frequently so you never know what you're going to get. Had their curry eggs, agnolotti, and I think, beef tongue? Everything was delicious and the service was top-notch. Never felt rushed and enjoyed our time.\", \"Four Horsemen is a fantastic spot! The desserts are to die for--particularly the seasonal fruit tart. Each time I visit, the menu features new and exciting options, and the staff is always eager to offer great wine pairings. It's clear that a lot of care goes into both the food and the wine selection. Highly recommended for a memorable dining experience!\", \"This is top to bottom one of the best meals I've had in NYC. The Four Horsemen is a Michelin-starred restaurant and natural wine bar co-owned by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. The menu changes frequently but the food is always amazing. \\n\\nWe started off with their famous yellowfin tuna, and housemade bread and butter that changed my life. The oeuf mayonaisse is a work of art, and the marble potatoes are absolutely incredible, with charred scallion, smoked trout roe, and bonito flakes. We finished strong with a juicy golden chicken covered in morel mushrooms and roasted garlic. \\n\\nThe prices are surprisingly good here for a Michelin-starred spot. Our bill for two people came out to $179.64 which included everything we ate here and multiple drinks.\", \"Amazing food AND service. When we initially sat down, there was a group next to us who were extremely loud and the staff happily relocated us and proceeded to give us AMAZING service.\\n\\nWe ordered multiple things off of the menu and everything was delish! The skin contact wine was yummy as well.\\n\\nWe ended our meal with some olive oil cake and complimentary wine pairings since they ran out of one of the things we ordered. I'll definitely be back here!\\n\\nVery intimate spot!\", \"Don't sleep on the warm house bread. I'm going to be dreaming about it for the next few years. It would have been the star of the entire meal, but the Pork Loin Chop stole the show. It was cooked to perfection! Everything else was also really tasty but those are the one's I'm going to call out. The service was great. Our server helped is pick a bottle of wine and it was delicious. The inside is a low light intimate kind of place, but it can get a bit noisy because of how small the restaurant is. Recommend this place for a more laid back fine dining vibe!\", \"Loved the four horsemen, very glad I stopped in on a recent trip to NYC. Didn't have a reservation but was able to walk in shortly after opening and grab a seat at the bar (the restaurant is small). \\n\\nStarted with a tasty orange wine, the bartender was very knowledgeable about wines and helped me choose the perfect one. Also helped me through the menu and the amount to order.\\n\\nEverything was delicious. Fun combinations, fresh ingredients, full of textures and nice acidity throughout which made the meal overall not feel heavy. The hand chopped wagyu tartare was delicious, as was the fluke with sesame oil, orange and furikake. Great starters. Next up was the celery salad - best celery dish I've ever had, so simple but so delicious with piave vecchio, dates, walnuts and mint. After that we did the whole grilled shrimp, very fresh with nice thai flavors and some heat, ate everything including the head and tails. And the spinach tonnarelli with burrata, smoked chile and thyme flowers - this one was great but my least favorite of the bunch.\\n\\nDefinitely worth stopping in, try as many things as you can.\", \"Getting a reservation at this place can be a bit tricky, but luck was on our side when we snagged a lunch opening.\\n\\nOur taste adventure started with the Merasheen Oyster, and wow, it was pure deliciousness! The oysters were simply amazing, although the smoked trout roe added a touch of smokiness that slightly overpowered the oyster's delicate flavors. Still, it was a delightful dish that left us wanting more.\\n\\nNext up was the Rhode Island Squid.  Perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavors, every bite was a delight for the palate.  The Romaine Heart Salad didn't quite wow us like the other starters, but everything else on our table was an absolute delight. The Grilled Swordfish was good, but let me tell you, the Pork Milanese stole the show. The pork was fried to perfection, crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. Combined with the refreshing cucumber and parsley, it was a match made in foodie heaven.\\n\\nIf you're up for a fantastic dining adventure, I highly recommend planning ahead and savoring every moment at this wonderful establishment especially if you're a wine person!\", 'Food is always amazing!! Service is awesome! The ambiance is very lovely and romantic. \\nStill dreaming about the Yuzu Ricotta Tuna', 'Came in for lunch and had no issue getting a table for 2. The restaurant itself is lovely. The decor and artwork displayed just adds to the experience. They have a sick sound system and were playing great tunes.\\n\\nI like how the menu is constantly changing, and they are using what is fresh. I genuinely enjoyed every bite I had.\\n\\nThe service was great as well! Our server was very knowledgeable and happy to help guide us in choosing what we wanted. I definitely will come back!', \"TLDR: Walked in not a wine lover, but walked out as one. Food lived up to the hype, but $50 for half of a chicken was a lot (twas a great chicken though).\\n\\nCame with a friend and shared practically half the menu. There were no misses on the menu; EVERYTHING was great. Our favorites were the house bread, celery salad, beans, sweetbreads, and the curry butter chicken. The crab was also very good. The house bread was probably one of my favorite breads I've had and the celery salad was so surprising. I never thought I would ever say that one of my favorite dishes at a restaurant would be a salad of celery. The curry butter chicken was perfectly cooked, full of buttery curry flavor, and even though it was $50 I might think it was worth it. \\n\\nThere were two options for dessert, but I personally wasn't too impressed by either of them. I felt that both the semifreddo and Basque cheesecake were pretty standard. If I had to choose one, it would be the semifreddo. \\n\\nYou do not need to order as much as we did. For a normal pair of people that don't feel compelled to try everything, just 4-5 dishes would be enough. Service was pretty friendly and if you don't know much about wines (like us), they shared their opinions and knowledge about wines. We just told them what flavors we liked and what we were eating and they basically chose for us. \\n\\nOverall: if this were in Manhattan and easier to book, I'd probably be here once a week. Still thinking about the bread, celery salad, and curry chicken weeks later.\"]}, {'id': '47-Zk7oz8-jVS2zvXbZgHQ', 'name': 'Bar 56', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0QEkX14W2_AluaM7vR15FQ/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://www.bar56dumbo.com', 'display_address': '53 Water St', 'display_phone': '', 'rating': 4.8, 'reviews': ['Bar56 is a delight in DUMBO, effortlessly blending top-notch cuisine, a stellar wine list, and warm hospitality. \\n\\nThe menu offers a delightful mix of flavors, with dishes that are as artfully presented as they are delicious-- I have tried most dishes on the menu, all of which have been a personal favorite.

What an absolute hidden gem in DUMBO!  I cannot believe this place wasn't completely full.  Maybe it was the time of day we went.  Either way, DO NOT SLEEP on this place!\\n\\nCame here with a friend (who seemed to know everyone who worked there due to frequenting the place) for dinner, and I can see this being a good place for a romantic dinner as well or even a large group.\\n\\nEverything we tried was ridiculously good:\\nPotato Croquettes \\nHiramasa Crudo\\nTuna tartare\\nRavioli al Uovo - to die for, do not miss\\nOrechiette \\n\\nAnd for dessert the strawberry rhubarb panna cotta was one of the best things I've ever had.\\n\\nOverall, would definitely come back here!!!\", \"I'd rate Bar 56 four and a half stars.\\n\\nModern restaurant with a large wine selection and a globally influenced menu. The restaurant is located on the southwestern corner of TimeOut market with an entrance on the western segment of the building.\\n\\nWe dined in on a Tuesday evening and were seated immediately. In retrospect, I'm shocked that we found that restaurant completely empty and still well below half capacity as we departed. Bar 56 is an excellent choice if you want upscale experience without the hype and long waits.\\n\\nThe restaurant is connected to a wine shop, so the wine menu immediately stands out. I believe there were at least fifty wines offered by the glass. I had a two different Pinot Noirs - one from Oregon and another from South Africa. The wine menu is pretty informative but could be overwhelming with the plethora of options. \\n\\nWe started with an order or bread and butter with the bread baked at the neighboring Almondine Bakery. My wife loved the bread. Bread was useful in mopping up a lot of the sauces used in the dishes we ordered. I'd recommend saving some for throughout the meal as they'll charge you for a full order if you ask for a couple more slices later on. \\n\\nNext came out the baby beet panzanella. This ate much like an Eastern European beet salad but with a sophisticated presentation. The flavors were nostalgic for me. I liked how the creaminess worked with the beets. The pine nuts seemed overshadowed to me.\\n\\nSoon after we were served the Hiramasa Crudo. I believe Hiramasa is yellowtail. I'm not entirely sure of the difference. The fish does an excellent job of absorbing the brisk and citrusy dressing. It was cut on the thicker side giving the bites a more meaty texture. There were some accompaniments like minced heart of palm which took a reserved role.\\n\\nFor the main course, we shared the Raviolo al Uovo and the Lamb Neck. The ravioli is one enormous ravioli filled with ricotta and easy done egg. It's was covered in what I believe was a pumpkin butter sauce. There's something so playful about one giant ravioli that always delights me. It's an ultra savory dish between the cheese, egg, and sauce. Maybe best to not get your cholesterol checked after this one. Nevertheless, it was our favorite item and a must order.\\n\\nThe lamb neck was served as an easy to eat block with a side of three pieces of cauliflower covered in a curry sauce. The lamb was crisped on both sides adding a very crunchy texture reminiscent of being cooked on a spit with high heat. It was seasoning with boldy, earthy spices typically used with middle eastern preparations. Lamb was tender but not mushy. \\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the basque cheesecake served with a berry coulis and almond crumb. I liked the contrast of textures even within the cheesecake there were some airy sections and some dense ones. The coulis was quite strong.\\n\\nDecor was modern and the restaurant had a downtown ambiance. Most customers were dressed nicely but I don't think a patron would look too far out of place in athletic wear. There is an open kitchen overlooked by the bar. Service was very attentive. There were two gender neutral restrooms with one being handicap accessible; both were spacious.\", \"Bar56 surprised me so much! For a nicer dining place, I was surprised that my party could get reservations so easily. Walking in, the first thing I noticed was the nice ambiance and vibes of the place. It felt elevated but not too much. Our service the entire night was fantastic, with our main waiter constantly checking in and teaching us about the menu and drinks. As for the food, the stars of the show were actually all the vegetables. The beet salad appetizer was possibly my favorite thing of the day, I can't recommend it enough! All the food was great!\", 'Quaint spot nestled in Dumbo, next to the Time Out Market (Brooklyn). Found this spot while looking for a nice restaurant in the area for a date night dinner. We enjoyed a couple dishes on their menu and enjoyed each bite. Started off with their bread service, had the Cappellacci as an appetizer, and shared the Sakura Pork and Branzino for our main. \\n\\nAlmondine Bread: Their bread service, not cheap nor expensive, started the meal right. Served with Vermont butter, the toasted and warm sourdough and baguette were also great vessels for scooping up any sauces from our other dishes.\\n\\nCappellacci: This pasta dish blew us away. Buttery and rich but smooth and well-balanced from the balsamic reduction. The portion was bigger than we would have assumed - can definitely be ordered as a main.\\n\\nSakura Pork: The pork was well-seasoned (albeit a bit salty for my preferences) and juicy. The pickled vegetables on the side was amazing - great change of flavor profile and crunch. \\n\\nBranzino: Our favorite dish of the night. The Branzino was perfectly cooked. The meat was plump and moist; the skin was nice and crunchy. The broth/sauce was surprisingly refreshing - which we did not expect. The spinach and thai basil made it refreshing while the mussels added a brine-y flavor without it being overpowering. \\n\\nAll in all, great meal and great atmosphere. Although small and unassuming, food and service were top-notch. This spot is relatively new to the neighborhood (opened July 2023) but looking forward to what more they can bring to the table.', \"I loved almost everything from my visit to the Bar 56 and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a delicious dinner in the DUMBO area. For drinks, my partner and I shared a bottle of rosé but the cocktail menu had a few drinks that caught my eye. Alas, when in a wine bar, I must choose the wine. \\n\\nFor food, we did the pre-fixe and I had the Hiramasa Crudo, Cappellacci, Arctic Char, and Bijou. Although the Artic Char was a miss (it needed more flavor), every other dish was stellar. I'm not a dessert person but the Bijou was my favorite course. Very simple and elegantly plated yet the salty creaminess of the goat cheese combined with the sweet honey and tart apple mustard mixture, blew me away. More restaurants should offer this type of upscale mini charcuterie board as a dessert option.\\n\\nIn addition to the food and drinks being great, our service was wonderful. Our server Valentina, gave helpful recommendations for all of the dishes and she was steering me towards the Bijou. She was lovely our entire time and I think it added to how much I enjoyed the energy in the space. \\n\\nI'm elated that I got to try so many delicious dishes here and I will certainly find a reason to come back. AND when i do, my first ordered item will be the Bijou!\", \"Lovely diner at Bar 56. Staff were very friendly their wine selection was excellent and the food was delicious and well executed. \\n\\nI ordered the $85 Pre-Fixe menu. I had the brussel sprouts, lobster pasta, lamb neck and olive oil cake. The plating is beautiful, the chef understands that your eyes eat first. \\n\\nThe portions are small but considering the table bread it ends up being the perfect amount. Lamb neck was definitely my favorite but brussels and lobster was so well balanced and flavorful. \\n\\nI think the olive oil cake was good execution wise but Im not the biggest fan of olive oil cake (I did eat it all tho lol). Next time I'll try a different dessert. \\n\\nIf you're hanging out or visiting the waterfront in dumbo you can't go wrong with Bar 56!\", \"10s across the board! \\n\\nI'm so glad my friend suggested this place for a fun Saturday night. The ambiance is warm and inviting. The service was top-notch and the servers were attentive and friendly. \\n\\nWe did the prix fixe menu at $85 for four courses, such a steal! I had the hiramasa crudo, langoustine, the branzino and the olive oil cake.  All were super delicious and bursting with flavor. The langoustine was a standout dish, I'm still dreaming of the sauce! The drinks elevated the entire experience. \\n\\nA must visit!\", \"Had the BEST time here last night with some friends. Every single food and drink item on their menu was just amazing and enjoyable, and the service was super attentive all night. \\n\\nWe did the prefixe menu for $85 and I went with the crudo, ravioli, branzino and olive oil cake. I also tried the potato croquettes, the langoustine and cappellacci, and the crème brûlée. Everything was delicious, no complaints from our whole table. I think the langoustine was a stand out dish for sure, as well as the hiramasa crudo. The addition of the basil and blood orange on the crudo was just such a great touch. \\n\\nFor $85, it's also a TON of food. I could barely finish my branzino and dessert. 10000% recommend this restaurant, you will not be disappointed.\", \"Came here after work with a friend and was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was! Located right next to the time out market in dumbo, this place is super chic and cozy. Perfect for a date night or catching up with friends. They have an extensive wine list (56 to be exact) and cocktails/beer. The waitress was super sweet & was able to help me pick the perfect wine once I told her what I usually like. The food is made for sharing (small plates, recommend 2-3 per person) and each one was uniquely delicious. I definitely recommend getting a pasta dish, those were my favorite. \\n\\nWe had a reservation but it was relatively empty on a Wednesday at 630 so not sure if that's necessary. They also have plenty of bar seating & I was told a happy hour special from 5-6pm on weekdays. They will surely be seeing me again soon!\", 'The spot was a quiet with an exquisite atmosphere. The appetizers were delicious the bites were very small and a bit pricey but every bite was delicious. The wait staff was very attentive.', 'Great service, great pasta, but really small portions. I would go again, but would love something with more meat and bigger portions.', 'Simply Underrated. This fairly new place is doing everything right, staff has amazing hospitality, food was impeccable and the overall experience was top notch. Our experience with the Manager (Yajaira) to our waitress (Valentina) they broke us down the menu, wine options and even had some champagne for us celebrating our anniversary. The pre-fix menu is filled with great options, choices of protein along with the sides and sauces that complement them to bring out great flavor with your choice of wine. Furthermore, our water glasses were consistently filled, our courses brought out in a timely manner and we did not fell rushed to eat our meal. We were able to enjoy the perfect sized meal options which from the start to the end the flavors were just amazing.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a try for a week night with their bar specials or even on a weekend for a nice dinner and a nice location to celebrate an occasion.\\n\\nYou heard it here, this place had open reservations but soon that will not be the case as their food and success will take off.', 'Food: Excellent. Ordered five small dishes. The standouts: pork belly, crudo, artichokes.\\n\\nDrinks: Martinis were divine.\\n\\nService: Outstanding. Friendly service; came by our table just the right number of times. Right amount of banter.', \"Had such a nice time here, i know this place is new and the location/ambience is beautiful. The music playlist they had going was great and the service was top notch. \\nThe menu wasn't too excessive, all the dishes showed expertise and refinement. \\nWe started with a nice red blend and the smoked peaches appetizer and hamachi appetizer, as well as bread and butter. \\nThe peach dish was divine but they only give you 5 tiny pieces of peach, maybe equaling half a peach in total, and a good amount of cheese (an incredible mix of 3 cheese - to die for). Would have been nice to have a bit more peaches. we ended up ordering another one just to get more. The bread was perfectly charred though and they offered to bring more. \\nThe hamachi appetizer was great quality but the flavors and pistachio garnishes didn't really give it a strong enough flavor to me. \\nFor mains we tried the salmon and lamb neck. Good but not great. The salmon is a sous vide style preparation which is exquisite in its involvement but this one was a bit too mushy and essentially had no seasoning. The sauce and caviar it was served with were the only things that had flavor, but even with that and the onion it still couldn't elevate enough to wow me.\\nThe lamb neck was tender but a little too fatty. The sauces were good and accompaniments of veggies were yummy. \\nI had a bit higher hopes from the food here but still a great experience and actually the prices were way lower than i expected so i guess it all averages out. Great value here.\", \"Bar 56 has some of the best service I've ever experienced. The hostess made accommodations for us, our server helped with the menu and helped us understand while giving suggestions, and whole staff was wonderful. Friends and I did the pre-fixed menu and left absolutely stuffed. Of course we tried the wine and with their huge wine selection there was something for everyone. Appreciate the graphics on the menu pairing different dishes with different wine. Will be returning!\", 'Happened upon this restaurant after visiting their sister wine store next door. \\n\\nWe had a really nice meal and everything was honestly a 10.

Definitely worth every dollar', \"The staff and ambiance at Bar56 were both incredible. We spent time chatting with the owner, James and really enjoyed his company. We felt taken care of at every corner. My water was never empty and the food came out hot and perfectly timed. The wine recommendation was spot on, as were the food suggestions. Our waiter suggested the Capellini pasta with the parsnip filling and it ended up being our favorite. Unique and delicious. We will 100% be back. Best meal we've had in awhile.\", \"Visited Bar 56 with family yesterday. What a great experience we had. The restaurant is beautiful the service was amazing and the chef even came out himself to explain a new item on the menu . It was a pumpkin kind of popover . Can't do the name any justice but it was so good . We all ordered a few items to share and not one disappointed us. Planning my next visit because I'm definitely be going back.\", \"Convenient location if you are in the Dumbo area and want to grab something of a traditional meal that's not from the food court. The service is very fluid and attentive, partially because there aren't many  customers. The food is above average if you stick to smaller plates. The most disappointing was the dry aged beef. The wine selections are good, but be warned they are quite overpriced.\", \"This new tasting restaurant in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn is amazing. The restaurant serves small plates, for sharing or for yourself. The restaurant itself is so beautifully decorated, you relax as soon as you walk in the doors. The entire staff is welcoming and on top of their game. If you don't know what you want to eat, they will go over everything with you. They even have a sommelier to help you with wine pairings. They have a regular menu and then seasonal offerings as well. Everything is delicious, from the breads and butter to the small plates to the desserts, and the cocktails are beautiful. I can't wait to come back!\", \"Lovely dinner at Bar 56.  Service, food, and overall ambiance was great.  My wife and I had a belated Valentine's Day dinner here and everything was great.  Staff was exceptionally friendly and were very accommodating.  I think perhaps the best service I've seen at any restaurant in NYC!  \\n\\nWe ordered the prix-fixe course where we got to choose an appetizer, pasta dish, main dish, and a dessert.  All the food came out with great timing, everything was paced so that we could enjoy our food but also not too late where we were left with empty plates.  All the dishes were very tasty and perfectly cooked.  \\n\\nI would suggest this place to anyone who wants good food, great service, and a nice vibe.  It's also just a few steps away from the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Carousel.  Walk the area before/after your meal for a lovely, romantic date.\", 'I never write reviews but I just had to write one for this place because it was so outstanding. The ambiance of the location is so cool and vibey it is in a prime DUMBO location. They accommodated our party of 20 on a last minute reservation and went above and beyond, right down to even customizing a happy birthday message to my sister on the prix fixe menu. All of the staff were so beyond nice and accommodating, genuinely good people. And the food!!! Each dish was absolutely incredible. I tried everything on the prix fixe and each dish was spectacular with well crafted ingredients and flavors. The drinks were off the charts amazing with a crafty cocktail menu. LOVED it so much cannot wait to go back.', 'Super cool space, lovely staff, and the food is exquisite. My one complaint is the pricing - very small portions for top dollar. That said- I will be back. Cuisine as good as this is not to be missed. Bravo!!', \"When you walk into this restaurant, you realize you're in for unique experience, the high ceiling, the wood beams, the stone wall made from leftover stones from the Brooklyn Bridge, and the food! dishes may sound like something you've had before, but nothing is like anything you had before. Everything on the menu is delicious and a new treat.\\n The best wine list I've ever seen with 56 wines listed and explained.

When you walk out the door you're already planning your next trip back.\", \"The best food we've had in Dumbo. Had to say the potato croquettes and artichokes were the best I've had. Also Ravioli oysters and the pork dish were quite good. Highly recommend trying out.\", \"Just had early dinner there after show.  Service and ambience is exceptional - thank you!  Raviolo Al Uova is the best pasta dish I've had in many years - so crazy good and it is filling.  We loved the potato croquettes.  Dish we would pass on is the Cappellaci -meh at best.  Overall I would come back to this establishment next time I'm in dumbo.\", \"This place is a much needed upscale wine bar in the neighborhood. The service was top notch.

We were a party of nine and had made a reservation for a table however it was a bar top with seating for six and they stuck extra stools in there. This was an issue to begin with but more so since there were some larger people and we just physically could not fit and have plates to eat. They told us they didn't have another table and just pulled it from the wall and added barstools to each end which still wasn't enough but to make up for it they served us all terrible fruity shots. \\nThankfully the guacamole for the table was very good and my steak sandwich, which came rare instead of medium rare, was good although overpriced at $27.

Very good drink selection with lots of classic cocktails. They have a great cab sav that paired so nicely with the margarita flatbread. Good melt on the cheese and a really tasty flatbread. I got the steak salad and it was perfectly cooked steak and lots of fresh greens. The various seasonal options are always quite good and the service really is very good. Great spot!', \"Cool atmosphere and vibe but I have to assume it's those attributes and the mimosas that drive the high ratings. The food is bland and very basic. So come enjoy the vibe but manage expectations when it comes o the food.\", 'Hanging out in New York City for my (at the time) girlfriend\\'s birthday and we are always on the hunt for bottomless mimosas in the best city in the world! So we did our usual Yelp due-diligence ultimately finding... Dutch Fred\\'s. Here\\'s how it went!\\n\\nAtmosphere/Appearance: We came here with our friend Aaron who\\'s always down for action so we made reservations which were promptly honored when we arrived. The restaurant is in a more elongated setting like a lot of big city establishments are. It\\'s difficult to describe decor here, but I would say, \"modern tavern\" is what it felt like. Tile floors, a generic ceiling, some wood paneling and a single row of lights illuminates the entire restaurant, but not too brightly. The left side of the interior is the bar rail with booths and other tabletop seating sprinkled throughout.\\n\\nService: I couldn\\'t tell you who took care of me this time, but I\\'m sure if I had an issue I would\\'ve remembered. I know she was a lot of fun.\\n\\nFood: I mmmeeeaaannn... do we really care about the food is the mimosas are flowing? The short answer is yes, but the long answer is the more mimosas you have the less you care. Lol. However, the Breakfast Flatbread was delightful. I needed the carbs so it\\'s a flatbread consisting of a mozzarella/cheddar cheese mix, chorizo, sausage, caramelized onions, red pepper and topped with 2 sunny-side-up eggs. I ain\\'t want my pizza THAT messy so I swapped the sunny-side-up action for some scrambled eggs. Like I said, delightful, filling and flavorful. The mimosas were on point and no too juicy at all. The Dutch\\'s Punch was actually pretty refreshing as well.\\n\\nValue: It\\'s New York City, but peep game... $30.00 gets you unlimited mimosas, bloody marys and Dutch\\'s Punches for \"90 minutes\". However, you do need to purchase an entree so you\\'re probably looking at around $70.00 max out the door per person including taxes and tip. Not terrible in the grand scheme of what you get!\\n\\nIn conclusion, I loved this place and had a great time hanging out here!

The cocktails are high quality, there's plenty of good beer on offer, and although they didn't know what my friend was talking about when he asked for a Spaghett, to be fair, neither did I (it's a beer with an aperol floater, and it's delightful in the summer). \\n\\nThis last visit, we ordered a few starters. The Bang Bang shrimp are fried well, and topped with chili crisp (my favorite condiment), the pork belly baos are quite tasty, and the buffalo chicken sliders were actually the winner of the three. Very well done. It seems to me that the menu probably has a lot to offer, so I think I'll be back next time I find myself in the neighborhood. \\n\\nIf you find yourself in the general area and don't want to have hot dogs for dinner (how I ended up here), Dutch Fred's is a good choice.\", \"Date: Sunday, May 5th, 2024\\nTime: around 2:30pm\\nParty of: 5\\nWhat: After Lunch Drinks\\n\\n*Brooklyn Bootlegger ($18)\\n*Monkey Shoulder: neat ($19) x2\\n*Sixth Sense ($17)\\n*Oban Little Bay: neat ($19)\\n\\nAfter lunch, my group of 5 wandered to Dutch Fred's.

It was smoky, a tad spicy, but just right for a fall evening. \\nAs we all came together, we changed our table to better align with our group's needs. The waitress had no problem accommodating us.

Our server was friendly.\\n\\nHowever, it took a VERY long time for our food to arrive. 35 minutes from time of order to delivery and my food was cold (had the two sunny side up eggs on the chorizo/cheese flatbread). It may have been that they held my food until my daughter, who was late, ordered her waffles, but they should have asked me if I wanted to get my food at the same time or when it was ready. Because my food was cold, it was hard to really judge how it would have tasted had it been fresh. As it was, rubbery fried eggs on cold flatbread was not super appealing. My daughter's waffles were fine.

Dutch Freds made for a nice refuge to enjoy some bites, beers and cocktails for a couple of hours.\\n\\nStopping in a little before 5pm on a summer Saturday the large space was sparsely filled since we were a little early for prime time. I immediately noticed that faint musty cocktail bar smell that many cocktail bars/irish pubs have - not off putting, but noticeable. The space is a comforting mix of subway and decorative tile, modern lighting, dark wood tables which made me feel happy about our choice.\\n\\nWe enjoyed a mix of cocktails and beers. The Dutch Courage was nicely balanced with gin, fresh mint, lemon and celery bitters. I stuck to mainly beers (Ebbs Gose No. 1 must be the beer of Summer '23 because I am finding it everywhere - love that sour watermelon brew). I also tried the Karate Kid which felt more like a fall drink with the star anise addition to the Tenjaku Japanese Whiskey, basil syrup, lemon & bitters.\\n\\nFor food we went with the Bang Bang shrimp which were a generous amount of nicely fried shrimp on top of a bowl of salad - the bang bang came from a slightly spicy honey sriracha ( they must have cut back on the sriracha due to the shortage in 2023 lol ) sauce on the side - shareable and enjoyable. The smashed burger was on trend and tasty. The Brisket Flatbread was a nice, meaty thin crust pizza cut into little triangle bites. \\n\\nDutch Freds hits that sweet spot when you are looking for some shareable bites with food that is better than it needs to be with such a strong cocktail and beer selection making it an easy choice to escape Time Square hell.\", 'Really great for a cute, pre show drink and bite to eat!

We sat toward the back where there was a fireplace on TV, and it was quite cozy! The lighting was dim but not too much so that I couldn't read the menu. The music was also controlled so I could hear the folks in my group. \\n\\nWill be back the next time I'm in the area for a show!\", 'Nice bar in the theater district. A little off the beaten track.

Limited brunch menu but food was very good.', 'Recently I went to dutchs Fred with a few of my friends. I had one friend in the group who had been there a few times and requested we try it. I would say I definitely thought this place would be more low-key but on a Saturday night it was filled with a lot of people and all the seating was taking up. It was loud but not loud enough where you had to be screaming and they had nice Christmas decor up around the establishment. \\n\\nMy friends and I sat at a booth in the back. It seems that the back of the restaurants were all high tables which is cool just a heads up. Our waitress greeted us after a few minutes and was ready to take our drink order. We ordered numerous amount of items from the small bites section of the menu. All of the food was absolutely delicious and the drinks were even better. I would love to go back and try more items off their menu. I would say their menu was shockingly small but it did seem more of a social place and the food that they do have were amazing. \\n\\nFood: Potato Croquettes, Sweet potato Fries, Regular fries, Chicken Tenders, Fried Chicken Sandwich *Chefs Kiss*\\n\\nDrinks: Epresso Yourself, Mocktail Happy Feet, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Gramble \\n\\nI would definitely love to go back.', \"Sexy bar with delicious food and killer cocktails. It's a great choice for a date night. \\n\\nNatalie couldn't have been more pleasant with us. She was outgoing, patient and personable. She definitely helped us feel comfortable and made some key suggestions for our order. \\n\\nWe went for the 48-hour Slow-Roasted (pulled) Beef Brisket Sliders, the Smashed Burger and the Steak Sandwich. \\n\\nI gotta tell you: the sliders were to die for... Alone worth a visit. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. Every bite was a trip to heaven. The smashed burger was very good, too. The smashed sauce (which is absent in the normal burger, hence... order this one) was key in enhancing the flavor. The steak sandwich was absolutely delicious. High quality meat accompanied with yummy provolone cheese, portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions and chimichurri salsa. The French baguette bread came warm and crunchy. I only wish it were a little bigger! \\n\\nOverall, this was a home run. Food ain't cheap, but you can count on it being prepared really well. You really get what you pay for, here. I can't wait to return to taste other options from their rich menu. \\n\\nSuper recommended.\", 'Convenient Hells Kitchen spot for post show drinks and snacks. I absolutely love the seasonal cocktails here. They have some late night specials during the week. The staff has always been attentive and friendly. Really enjoying the seasonal Sleepy Hollow ($17). Also, the arugula flatbread ($17) was delicious and feeds two! The flatbreads were on special for $10. Well worth it!', 'I seldom eat burgers. But the burgers here really impressed me. Very delicious!! Paired with french fries. Then pair them with one of their unique drinks.', \"Honestly the best part about this place was the christmas ambiance, the decor was so cute inside and it was festive while still being cozy. Unfortunately the service and food left a lot to be desired. We received a flatbread which was not ordered & our server kept insisting that our table had ordered it (at the end they realized it was for another table). I ordered the seared tuna and while it was very fresh, it would have been a bit more appealing had the slices been cut a little thinner. \\n\\nOne thing that bothered me was the lingering smell of the cleaner. While I appreciate the cleanliness effort, it was not the more pleasant to eat surrounded by an odor of bleach. Overall, it's a pretty classic midtown spot.\", \"My frequent NYC go-to. Lovely atmosphere, sophisticated cocktails, and delicious food. We would recommend this place for a laid back chilled vibe with excellent small bites and other great drinks.  We ordered a variety of food to share & everything was so delicious & fresh! Our faves were eggplant chips, veggie sliders, and chicken mousse dumplings. Late night menu has been updated recently and they've added lot of new options. Chef will make changes to the entree based on dietary restrictions as well. \\n\\nStaff was super friendly! A lovely Irish woman waited on us and she was delightful. Would recommend and would visit again! Hope this was helpful!\", \"When you're looking for a stop to grab a bite and a drink after a show, this is the place to go.

Service is always great; fast and friendly!\", 'Dutch Fred\\'s in Hell\\'s Kitchen has earned its spot as a fantastic locale for socializing with friends, making it a solid 4-star experience overall. The inviting atmosphere and the ease of walking in with a group of 5 on a Saturday without a reservation added to the positive vibe.\\n\\nThe drink selection, though the espresso martinis were standard, offered variety with the Happy Feet mocktail and Freddy\\'s Mules. It set the stage for a delightful evening of drinks and bites.\\n\\nOur group opted for a family-style feast, sharing a variety of plates. The pork belly bao buns were a standout, earning a solid 8/10 for their great taste and soft buns. The chips & guac scored a 6.5/10--tasty guac, but a bit more chips would have elevated the experience. Unfortunately, a mix-up resulted in regular fries instead of the ordered garlic Parmesan fries we were charged for, bringing the score down to 2/10. Sweet potato fries were an average 6/10, and the bang bang shrimp scored a respectable 7/10 - ample shrimp but lacking a bit in the \"bang bang\" department. The 48hr slow-roasted beef brisket sandwich earned a solid 7/10 for its good taste and flavorful marinade.\\n\\nThe staff, while friendly, seemed quite busy, which impacted the overall service experience. Despite this, Dutch Fred\\'s stands out as a go-to spot for a lively gathering with friends, offering a satisfying mix of drinks and bites. A few hiccups in the food service prevent it from reaching perfection, but the positives outweigh the negatives, securing its 4-star rating in my book.']}, {'id': '1aD88qNRb08LGBkl84GQTA', 'name': 'Little Collins', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/slFDwKBC58jMyNJbjh1QkA/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'http://www.littlecollinsnyc.com', 'display_address': '708 3rd Ave', 'display_phone': '(212) 308-1969', 'rating': 4.4, 'reviews': [\"If you're looking for a breakfast spot, this is THE place.

Our server, Anzhane, was incredible! She really made the experience so special and exciting. 10/10 would recommend and go again! Such a nice vibe in the restaurant as well.', 'The fish was amazing. \\nLoved the Christmas music. \\nEddie was really respectful and funny. \\nThe drinks', 'On arrival. There was no wait time and Eddy was very accommodating with our seating arrangements. \\n\\nIf your a \"foodie\" (seafood specifically) you\\'ll smell the vibe literally. First time and it\\'s a dope spot.\\n\\nRobin was also supportive also. Great raves from friends hence why they took me here. \\n\\nAlso the bread though ... .', 'If you like seafood, this is the place for you! First things first tho...the price is PRETTY steep, in my opinion. BUT you are getting good food. Like I have come a few times and I have not been disappointed EVER!! Maybe disappointed in myself for not being able to eat it all but it\\'s good. \\n\\nI love the scallops and little steak pieces. They also have a chili fried fish and it\\'s soooo good. It\\'s a whole FISH so be aware and if you don\\'t think you can finish something like that. There is a chili fried fish in pieces , I think it was flounder. Their little clams are good too! They are small but they give you a whole basket full. If you order the crab legs , oof they are good. A lot of work per usual but if you are into that, go for it. \\n\\nBtw - there\\'s also the lobster option, where you can order the 2-3 different lobsters that are not included in the \"regular\" menu. I tried it once and I don\\'t think it\\'s worth it, if you cannot eat too much. I believe I only had like one lobster but it\\'s about 20+ more compared to the first price.  \\n\\nUsually, you can get a seat if it\\'s before dinner time. During dinner time, I\\'ll say about 5pm and later, you\\'ll see a wait. So if you have a group of people or a few ppl with you, make that reservation.', \"Lookey here!!!!! I visited this spot because the IG's looked delicious. Let me tell\\nYOU!!! I had to Tap Out. I selected the $110 lobster all you can eat and I did my best, but failed. The food was cooked to order and it tasted magnificent! Every time we thought we were done.... They came back to ask for our next order. I did  4 different types of shrimp, 2 different lobster tails, scallops, Mac n cheese with lobster,crab Rangoon, steak, and crawfish (I wasn't a fan of), Even with me not liking the crawfish, this place was amazzzzzzzzing. I was stuffed like Teddy Bear from build a bear!!!! \\n\\nI guarantee if you put the Crab House  n you list of must does n NYC you will be satisfied beyond expectation!!!\", 'Went back a second time with my work crew.  \\nPlace was pretty busy for a Monday night. \\nWe were seated promptly.  Our waiter was nice, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  We got everything we ordered swiftly and accurately on our first round.  For our second round, they took a bit longer and we did not get everything we checked off on their menu.  The lobster, steak and scallops were very, very good.  If you are a big eater and love the items I just mentioned, you must eat there.  My friend find their shrimp to be \"excellent\"... I feel it\\'s just average.\\nI am not a fan of the booth style of seating.  Every time anyone wants to go to the restroom, people gotta get out the way.  The floor under our table was VERY slippery (we speculated it was butter sauce spilled).  \\nOverall, I find this place to be a good value.  $115 for unlimited shrimp, lobster, crab legs and many other seafood if pretty great for midtown Manhattan.  \\nDrinks are extra.  As stated on their website, you CAN take leftover food home at an additional price (price subject to the staff based on what you have left uneaten).', \"The seafood is average, with most of it being frozen. The pricing is reasonable, considering it's an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) setup, and they do offer generous portions. There's a decent variety of options to choose from, but the seasoning is quite bland and underwhelming. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place or return in the future.\", \"Came here last Friday with friends after work. We thought we were a little overdressed in our work clothes but other guests came really dressed. I'd advise anyone coming here to dress casual. Once inside the staff was really helpful and seated us quickly. Once the menu was explained we started checking almost everything off on the menu. We then  all ordered a drinks. Food started coming out pretty fast and hot. I really enjoyed the seafood rice, scallops and baby back ribs. I would highly recommend the shrimp in super spicy sauce. We attacked all our food but we stayed to closing and were only able to eat one round. The all you can eat seafood buffet is worth it but still expensive. We were four people and bill was over $400.  It's a loud environment but everyone is far enough that other conversations aren't a distraction. Nice spot for groups.\", \"Everything about this place was amazing. My boyfriend brought me to celebrate my birthday and my obsession with seafood! It's all you can eat for almost two hours and you get to have everything under the sea!! My favorite of course were the unlimited king crab legs, breaded shrimp, seasoned fries, and wine!! Be sure to get Robin as your server he definitely set up the vibe for each occasion. \\n\\nEdit: I came back here two more times for my mom in laws birthday and since she was our 4th person and we came on her actual birthday she ate for free! I also came for another celebration with my boyfriend and each time Robin set us up for greatness- thank you Robin!\", 'I was really excited to try this place.  I had high hopes but it was just solid 3 stars.\\n\\nThe wait was ridiculous.  You can reserve if you don\\'t have 4 or more people.  So you need to walk in and wait about an hour or so during dinner time.  Interior was not bad.  Our waiter was prompt but we kept getting our orders wrong/not come out at all.\\n\\nFood was overall ok, with some items being great and some being bad, which I\\'ll list below.  And of course the \"good item\" portions were small and cheap stuff were way too much like the garlic noodles.\\n\\nRecommend: spicy blue crabs (best), oysters, shrimp\\nUp to you: snow crabs (salty), dungeness crabs (blend), garlic noodles (way too much)\\nPass:  little neck clams and scallops were not fresh and smelled', \"Saw this spot on IG and it was a must. My crew decided you only live once, so why not go all in. To start, we didn't have a reservation. Once seated it was time to get down to business. The bread looked good but I passed on it. Now for to the food, outstanding and you will not be disappointed. Everything was fresh,  fast to the table and on repeat. The pictures speak for themselves. Hands down one of the best experiences I've ever had.\", \"I have mixed feelings about my recent dining experience. While the lobster was disappointing, the scallops were amazing. The Crab Rangoon was surprisingly impressive, but the broccoli was undercooked. Inconsistencies were evident in the shrimp dishes and portion sizes. The oysters and clams lacked flavor. The lobster cakes were overpriced and undersized. I've definitely had better in other places.\\n\\nMy server was prompt initially but subsequently inattentive. Seated in the cold basement, I struggled to get attention for additional ordering. Addressing these issues would perhaps make me have a return visit, but currently, the high price does not justify the experience surrounding the occasionally impressive seafood.\\n\\nCrab House offers a winning combination of great food, it did have a  lively atmosphere, and exceptional service (when we received it), making it a must-revisit, especially for seafood enthusiasts. I just wouldn't recommend the lobster.\", \"This was a great place to visit for my first trip to NYC. For $80 per person you really can't beat the selection.\\nMost of the food was good with the exception of the calamari and the noodles. The interior is really nice, small and personable. The reason I am giving 3 stars is I feel that this is advertised as all you can eat however, after the first round of food, the amount of time it takes to receive anything extra is long. We had a large party and everything is brought out to be shared amongst the table. We felt that there was a delay in hopes that we would not order anything else.\", 'I wanted to love Crabhouse NYC--really, I did. The Instagram reels and stories had me hyped, expecting a seafood feast that would blow my mind. But after my visit, I can confidently say the only thing blown away was my wallet. For $115 a person, I left with more regret than satisfaction.\\n\\nHere\\'s the breakdown: I tried the mussels, lobster, edamame, broccoli, corn, shrimp fried rice, oysters, and crab Rangoon. Sounds like a feast, right? Well, it felt more like an expensive sampler platter of mediocrity. Nothing wowed me. The fried sea bass was equally unremarkable--just another dish on the table, not the star of the show. Even the margarita tasted like a fancy glass of lime juice with zero kick.\\n\\nNow, let me give credit where it\\'s due: the service is fantastic. The staff is attentive and friendly, so no complaints there. Also, if you plan to go, try arriving when they open at 2 PM to avoid the massive line.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the real tea: the value for the quality of seafood just isn\\'t there. The portions are underwhelming, the flavors are meh, and you\\'re essentially paying for the aesthetic (which, yes, looks great on Instagram, but is far from reality).\\n\\nCrabhouse NYC is giving influencer bait energy--but if you\\'re expecting a memorable dining experience to match the price, you might want to set your expectations lower than a tide at sunrise. Would I return? Not unless they\\'re serving a side of \"wow\" with those $115 meals.', '1st of picking your food and having it served well is AWESOME!! The chef in front helping us choose was great! Loved the vibe there!', \"Sadly, my recent trip didn't pass muster.  I've been to this location twice now and once in Coney Island area; all times were excellent and met the 5 star threshold.\\n\\nService was slow and the staff seemed a bit disorganized.  Looking around at the other tables, it looked like everyone else was being well attended.  At one point, they said they didn't have Dungeness, but later said that they did. \\n\\nFood itself was great and I love eating here.  It's a shame that the service and experience was poor.\", \"The service was great, but the food was horrible. I don't know why it is so popular. I didn't like any food in there unfortunately. Very greasy food , too much oil , we also ordered chicken and fish, super dry, no flavor\", \"Mannnnnn! Let me just say you need to experience this place. When we entered the location it was super  dim lighting and the host was super nice. We were seated and the waiter explained what we would be doing for the evening. He explained how to order items and the time it typically took for certain items. Our first round we ordered a lot of things: crawfish, shrimp, broccoli, edamame, scallops, steak, egg rolls, fried chicken, lobster, scallops, calamari and some seafood nuggets. Everything came to our table in about 10 mins. And the flavor was not compromised at all! I literally can't wait to go back!\", 'PLEASE come here if you love seafood. The smell is so amazing when you are walking down the stairs. Our server Ken was very nice and patient with me being it was my first time and I had a lot of questions.

I've never been to a buffet where so many seafood options were cooked to order. The price for the buffet didn't make the quality of food, meaning they could easily charge more per person. This is hands down one of the best value buffets in the whole country. Overall you ain't experienced NYC if you have not been here period!!!!\", \"Yes it is pricey, but if you focus purely on the seafood then it's worth it. I went here with several friends during my recent visit to NYC, after my friend made a reservation here about a month beforehand.\\n\\nGo with the premium buffet and devour all the lobsters you can. Fresh lobster with garlic butter is good, fresh lobster with salt and pepper is even better, and the spicy lobster claw was also good. Skip the mac and cheese as it loads up on carbs, which will fill you up. Order 5 of each for each person and you'll more than get enough value for what you pay. You can even order the snow crab leg, dungeness crab, and blue crab for some good crab value. Stick with the seafood and ditch the noodles/rice/pasta and you'll get to eat a lot here.\\n\\nService was not the best here, we had to pester our server a few times to get the amount of lobster we ordered for. The food was excellent though, so I can forgive the subpar service here.\", \"Runnnn don't want. Came here for my sisters birthday and robin took care of us. All you can eat, two different menus and everything came fast, hot, and delicious. Great service and even greater vibes. I loved everything we had and I'll definitely be back. The owner was nice to walk us to our table while carrying his baby around the whole time. Definitely see how hard this family works to keep this place running with everyone taking turns watching the baby, holding him and making sure he was entertained while working.\", 'The food was absolutely amazing. It was hot, delicious and served on time. We were not rushed. The team was very welcoming and attentive.', \"One of the best AYCE seafood feasts you can find in NYC!\\n\\nDefinitely worth coming for someone's birthday, for the comp birthday meal. We had two birthdays on the same day and were a party of 9. Our server was Ari and he was so attentive and sweet. We loved Ari!!!\\n\\nThe drinks are a hit or miss and depending on the day, I find their seasoning slightly on the salty side. But the food is still delish!\", \"Tik Tok and Instagram made me do it and I'm so glad they did! This place is exactly how others have shared and it was quite an experience!\\n\\nAs soon as we were seated, our waitress explained the process and let the games begin. This all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant gives diners the option to choose it with or without lobster, but why wouldn't we go for the lobster?\\n\\nWe pretty much selected everything from the sea, in addition to broccoli, mac & cheese, french fries, crab rangoon, garlic bread, but the main attraction was the abundance of food that was delivered. You name it, we had it, from fried whole snapper, salmon, many variations of shrimp, calamari, crab legs, blue crab, lobster tails, etc. It was phenomenal! I mean, the food was coming out so fast I had no time to snap pics!\\n\\nI paced myself, but for only the first round, we were full! Our waitress asked if we were ready for another round and we looked amazed because we were not prepared for more. Had we taken a walk around the block and come back, we would have been ready for more.\\n\\nThe service was good, the food was amazing, and if you don't arrive on time, be prepared to pack your patience. You do have the option to join their waitlist, which is a great tool!\\n\\nFoodies, it's the real deal... go try it now!\", \"I would rate 4.5 if possible. The Old Bay shrimp is good, but I'm not a fan of the spicy shrimp with the sweet chili sauce. Next time, I'll stick to the basics: iron steak, Old Bay shrimp (1 order), and unlimited crab. The chicken wings, pan salmon, and clam chowder are all no's for me. The shrimp fried rice was a disappointment--you'd expect quality fried rice at a restaurant like this, but it wasn't even edible. The crab legs are very fresh. The service was great. Although there's a 90-minute time limit, the staff had excellent timing when asking if I wanted to place a new order. I didn't feel rushed at all and definitely left full.\", 'February is my month of celebration and I finally took part in the highly talked about all you can eat seafood buffet known as Crab House. \\n\\nI can see why people really enjoy this place. However there are a few things to note...\\n\\n-They only accept reservations for parties of four or more (4+). \\n\\n-Everyone at the table orders from one menu and will be charged for the highest buffet price chosen. So if one persons wants lobster everyone is charged the lobster price. \\n\\n-Everything comes out at once but also staggered and out of order. Meaning apps, mains and sides but also meaning one of your apps can come out last after everything.\\n\\n-You can order as much as you want but you are charged a to-go price per person for anything you want to pack-up (consensus is the price can vary between $10/$15 for everyone in your party).\\n\\nI came on Friday in February as gift for my day. The wait was extremely long (over a hour) even for those with reservations. This place gets busy and service can sometimes feel fast paced and rushed. Once seated the atmosphere is loud but can be cozy in the individual booths. \\n\\nThis was our first time so we ordered what we thought would appeal to us. However, we quickly learned that a little strategy is required especially for a party of two. Since so many things can come out all at once, if I return, I would order only a couple dishes at a time. This will keep you from being overwhelmed or your food from getting cold. Some dishes were definitely better than others and some were just meh. \\n\\nI can definitely understand the appeal and the price is not a bad deal either. The experience was fun and enjoyable. \\n\\nJust A Note: \\n\\nIf you are celebrating your birthday and have a party of 4 or more, you (birthday person) will eat free. You have to dine on your birthday, the day before or the day after.', \"Crabhouse NYC is an absolute gem for seafood lovers, and it quickly became one of my favorite spots in Manhattan! We went for the $115 all-you-can-eat lobster option, and it was truly worth every penny. The variety and freshness of the seafood blew me away.\\n\\nWe started off with the lobster, which came out hot, perfectly drenched in some cajun sauce, full of tender, juicy meat. The crab legs were also a standout--fresh, succulent, and easy to crack, with the shells snapping perfectly, proving how fresh everything is. I was especially impressed with the scallops--they were buttery, tender, and cooked to perfection. They weren't overdone, which is a rarity at many places, and practically melted in your mouth.\\n\\nAside from the main seafood options, we tried some of the other offerings like shrimp and pan fried fish with sweet chili sauce. The shrimp was plump, seasoned just right with a great balance of flavors. The variety on the menu means there's something for everyone, but honestly, I focused mostly on the lobster and crab--because how often do you get unlimited of these?!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is also a big part of the experience. The boat-themed decor adds a fun, lively vibe, complete with wood paneling and nautical touches. It's a bit loud at times, but it just adds to the energy of the place. They provide bibs, which are absolutely necessary because things get messy--and that's part of the fun! Our server, (sorry forgot your name), was incredibly attentive, constantly bringing out more seafood without us even having to ask. He made the whole experience smooth and enjoyable, despite how busy the place gets.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that if you're not in the mood for seafood, they offer other options like steak and bbq spareribs, but honestly, the seafood is where it's at! For sides, we tried the lobster mac, calamari , which were good but not the highlight of the meal--the main stars were definitely the seafood dishes.\\n\\nIf you're planning on going, I highly recommend making a reservation because this place fills up fast, especially on weekends. And don't forget to come hungry--trust me, you'll want to get the most out of the endless lobster and crab! \\n\\nThey have a birthday promotion on Tuesdays (birthday person + 3 full priced customers).  Crabhouse NYC is perfect for big groups, celebrations, or if you just want to indulge in endless seafood. I'll definitely be back for round two!\", 'I have to say that this drive from CT was well worth it!! I will definitely be returning and will bring more of an appetite. I recommend this location!! Parking was a little pricey but we had a short walk.', 'Came to crab house for a delicious Christmas meal. Got the \"all you can eat\" $80 buffet. The wait was 2hrs and 15mins, I hope it\\'s worth it!', \"A solid 5-star, if messy, experience.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed the spicy lobster claws and spicy shrimps. These were deliciously sauced with laǒgānmā. I knew these dishes would have some Chinese influence, but I was surprised by the extent of it.\\n\\nLobsters, of course, were the star of the show. I liked the one seasoned with garlic butter more. It was steamed, and so juicier and more tender. Still, it would have been a crime not to order both styles every round.\\n\\nDungeness crabs would have been the star, if we hadn't opted for the lobster buffet. I would definitely order more of those next time.\\n\\nRaw clams and raw oysters are musts as well, especially since they don't take up much stomach space.\\n\\nThe lobster balls were flavorful, but perhaps a bit over-seasoned. More than one round of those would have been bad for my blood pressure.\\n\\nI also recommend at least getting one round of lobster cakes.\\n\\nWe also tried the ribs, New Zealand mussels, scallops, and snow crab legs. All of them were delicious, except for that last one, but I thought they are quite skippable if you don't have a large appetite.\\n\\nThe reservation was a bit tricky. The website says you can get a ticket online an hour before your planned arrival, but on the Saturday night we went, the online line was always full. We were lucky another friend wanted to join, because they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 4. We made our last minute 9:30pm reservation, but were allowed in at 8:30.\", \"We (a party of 4) took our chances and walked in last Sunday (the day of the nyc marathon) without a reservation and were seated fairly quickly (apx 20-25 minutes). We opted for the lobster all you can eat dinner and it was outstanding! The scallops, the lobster, the shrimp, the fish, the cocktails...everything was absolutely delicious. Ricky our server was the cherry on top; he was incredible. 10's across the board!\", \"This place was really good!! I definitely think it's worth the price for how fresh and delicious everything was. I'd recommend ordering in batches because the food comes so quick, they were basically stacking everything on our table which was slightly overwhelming. Also, the portions are pretty large even though we were a party of 2. Service was also wonderful - they're pretty good at checking up on you.\\n\\nMust Get - Jumbo Crab Legs w/ Old Bay, Pan Seared Salmon, Cajun Garlic Butter Shrimp, Pan Seared Scallop, Old Bay Shrimp\\n\\nCould Save Your Stomach For Others - Fries, Crab Rangoon\", \"This is such an amazing AYCE seafood deal. I really loved the crab and lobster, but a lot of the non-seafood options surprised me too. The steak and the chicken wings were flavorful and delicious.\\n\\nThe space is also quite huge and perfect for small or large groups. The waiters are very quick to bring out your food and clean up any plates or garbage at your table. I wanted to try everything on the menu, but I'd say the must-haves are the scallops, mac n cheese, crab legs, and all the different shrimps!\", 'Such a fun experience. Definitely a locals spot.

My personal favorites are the scallops - wow - fried shrimp and ribs. The crab legs and lobster are good but they won't be the best you have ever had. The corn is the sweet. The broccoli is crunchy.

Noodles were chewy - super solid bowl of ramen. \\n\\nHighballs were refreshing - if you like gin and tonic the Chu hi would be a good fit, but I personally liked the yuzu one which was light, slightly sweet, and citrusy.\\n\\nCan't wait to come back - would love to check out this place during happy hour\", 'The search for the best ramen in Manhattan ends here.\\n\\nI have been reviewing and searching for a go-to ramen place in Manhattan for years now--I can say that Tonchin is my new number one ramen spot.\\n\\nThe reservation list and walk-up wait might be a while but it is well worth it. Tonchin has your typical ramen options as well as tsukumen. I got the Tokyo Ramen but my friend got the tsukumen of which I think I will have to try the next time I go.\\n\\nThe interior is a bit more upscale than other casual ramen places, and the prices do reflect that.\\n\\nThe food itself was a prefect balance between savory, salty, and clean. My only wish is that the meat slices were thicker. Each bowl comes with a generous amount of green onions, a half egg, and plentiful noodles.', \"Solid ramen spot! Definitely one of the best ramen spots I have had in NYC. Not the best I have had in the states, but it was pretty tasty. \\n\\nI definitely recommend getting the classic tonkotsu! The broth was rich, deep, and thick. I would get the smoked dashi ramen if you like clams/seafood. Personally, a little too clamy for my liking. And the char siu and noodle thickness was perfect. \\n\\nWe didn't get the shaved ice when we came because we were too full, but we did hear the people next to us say it was the best shaved ice they have ever had... So I would try it if your appetite is up for it! \\n\\nThe aesthetic of the restaurant was very nice, modern and upscale. And our server was very attentive! Overall, I would come back.\", 'Tonchin lives up to the hype! \\n\\nThe vegan ginger miso ramen was delicious, but I did not realize I needed to mix in the miso until a waiter told me \\u200d. And the mango bingsu was so refreshing on a warm day. \\n\\nThe vibe is pretty casual (despite how difficult it can be to get a reservation) and the noise level was great for casually chatting with friends.', \"Fabulous tiny ramen place. My friends had been before and wanted to return. The host was honest: he could seat us right away if we'd be done in 45 minutes. That worked for our group as some had theater tickets. Great, great ramen in such a good broth. Others were also eating their huge strawberry snow cone desserts. Festive!\", \"I kept hearing that this place had the best ramen in NYC. As a ramen lover (I ate 1 bowl of ramen everyday when I was in Japan), I had to check it out.\\n\\nAmbiance is very casual-- note though that it's kinda inconvenient to store your outerwear when you're sitting at the bar. Service was soso-- my draft beer came all wet and sticky because it had been spilt.\\n\\n- Fried fish buns: 10/10 (super yummy! The perfect appetizer to start off the meal. Loved the fried black cod and the sauce was to die for.)\\n- Spicy tantan ramen: 9/10 (loved the broth and loved the spice. The noodles were a bit disappointing though-- I prefer harder noodles but the noodles here were a bit too soft.)\\n- Tonkatsu ramen: 8/10 (the broth was very creamy and once again, noodle texture was off)\\n\\nI don't know if I just had super high expectations, but I wasn't too sure if this is THE ramen spot.\", 'Whenever we are in NY, I try to make reservations ahead of time.  Tonchin is a Michelin Star rated ramen spot with a couple other locations.\\nMenu is not large but what they do, they do well.\\nMy favorite is the spicy tan tan men, perfectly cooked noodles with a 6 min egg, chasu, minced pork, and bamboo shoot.\\nFunny thing or not, we had reservations and we arrived 15 min early.  We checked in but the host kept seating people who walked in with no reservations since our table wasnt ready and we had reservations she said.   Hmmm\\nTable for 2....anyehere.  no special request.', 'Walked in and got a seat at the bar right away on a busy Sunday during lunchtime. I got the original tonkotsu ramen bowl, and it was incredible! The broth was so buttery and fatty, so smooth. Flavors were on point and the pork was sliced nice and thin. Definitely a top tier ramen place.', \"5 stars for the service and the kakigori, 4 stars for the ramen. Grab a reservation if you can, because the wait is typically 45 minutes to 1+ hours for two or more people.\\n\\nThe ramen is solid (we've gotten almost every option at this point) but not our favorite. \\n\\nWhat is the real showstopper here though is their kakigori, or Japanese shaved ice. The coffee is our favorite (the server told us that it was the best one), and mango is pretty good too. \\n\\nI don't think they really allow people to JUST order kakigori, or you can't get a table maybe, so keep that in mind.\", \"This Michelin-rated ramen restaurant is the perfect spot to end the day in NYC. \\n\\nThe dimly-lit ambiance of Tonchin sets the mood for a cozy yet exciting night with friends or family. The menu consists of simple options yet they are beautiful and piping hot when served. The shishito peppers were a great start to our meal. It was charred evenly and was toasted perfection. The Tonchin classic Toyko tonkotsu and spicy tan tan are must-tries as they are the restaurant's best. Tonchin's ramen bowls are pleasing to the eye and taste even better. I loved how the broth was not too heavy. The noodles had a great texture and the chasu meat was cooked wonderfully. \\n\\nThe service was catered to fun crowds, and it was efficient. I love how Tonchin looks subtle on the outside, but on the inside, it is its own world.\", 'Chic ramen shop in midtown Manhattan. I walked in on a random weekday afternoon and was seated immediately at the bar with no wait. The staff at the bar were very nice and not overbearing. The spicy tan tan ramen was solid, but not my favorite in the city. The slices of chasu were not how I usually prefer chasu and the broth was too heavy.', \"If you're looking for some good ramen in NYC, then head to Tonchin! They open at 12PM, so make sure you go early for lunch cause the restaurant fills up fast. I got there 15 minutes before opening and I was first in line, but minutes after people started waiting in line after me. There were at least 20 people waiting before opening! Since I was first to be sat, I made sure to order first cause I've heard the food does take some time to be served. So if you have more people ordering before you, plan on waiting for a bit for your food to be served to you. The waiting is a good sign that they take their craft seriously! They do have several tables and a bar top for seating. The atmosphere can get a bit on the loud side, but that didn't bother me. Will be back again!\\n\\nTonkotsu Ramen: Highly recommend. The pork broth was flavorful with a hint of fish flavor. Their homemade noodles were firm yet chewy! It was so good, I went ahead and ordered extra noodles!\", 'I made a reservation for one well in advance since I knew this place booked up quickly. I sat at the bar. Everyone was quite attentive and polite. \\n\\nThe ramen was tasty. The noodles were firm, but delicate. The bamboo shoots had great umami flavor and the broth was rich. The Tokyo Rice Ball was very rich and decadent. Possibly it was a little too decadent. I felt quit sick immediately after the meal. I am not sure what happened, but I will not return.', 'Ambiance (5/5): The establishment is small, dark, but not loud. There is a front waiting area that connects to the bar where you can wait before you are seated. Without a reservation, I was hearing that the wait would be upwards of an hour for 2. However, we had our reservation well over a week in advance.\\nService (5/5): Our service was fast. We loitered after our meal for about 15-30 minutes and they did not try to kick us out! We appreciated that.\\nClassic Tonkatsu (5/5): No wonder this place has been awarded for a Micheline Bib Gourmand year over year! It is definitely one of my top ramen spots in nyc!! The broth has incredible depth. Their pork slices are unique that they are very thin but the flavors are marinated into the meat for a nice tender bite. The noodles were a chewy bounce. I definitely will be back to try their other ramens!', \"I came here to celebrate my birthday with my coworkers. This restaurant has been on my list of places to go since its been Michelin rated for years. Overall, it was a great experience except when service was lacking. It was hard getting the attention of wait staff at times for different reasons. Otherwise, I would've given this place fixe stars. Anyways, I'm glad that reservations were made as I'm not sure if we would have been able to be seated if we did walk-in. The menu is on a qr code that's in the middle of the table. You scan it and there's different sections such as for drinks, food, and the lunch special.  We all chose the lunch specials which are only monday-friday until 2:30pm. \\n\\nI got the Tsukun as my side which consists of a bun with ground chicken, ground pork, sesame oil, Japanese mustard sauce, and teriyaki sauce. For the ramen I got the smoked dashi which comes with homemade noodles, Tokyo tonkotsu pork broth, menma, egg, smoked fish oil, clams, radish sprouts, tobiko, and seaweed. I got hot sauce on the side aka the homemade spicy sauce. The roasted chasu pork too which was delicious with the ramen. I got the sparkling yuzu as a drink and the mango tonchin honey cream, mint shaved ice. I really enjoyed the shaved ice as it had bits and pieces of actual mango inside. Also, the restaurant surprised me with a happy birthday sign that came with a candle & vanilla ice cream.\", \"Tonkotsu ramen here redeemed NYC Japanese food scene for me. \\n\\nWe came on Sunday around 2pm and were told a 15-20 min wait for two and that was very accurate. We got bar seats and I appreciate the size of the bar seat. I appreciate the amount of room that we have at the bar seat. \\n\\nWe tried the curry & cheese chicken wings, the tonkotsu ramen and the smoked dashi ramen. The curry and cheese chicken wings were so flavorful and interesting combination. We both agreed that the tonkotsu ramen was the superior one. The broth was not fearful of salt but not too salty. More importantly, there was actually layers and depth of flavor in the broth. Smoked dashi ramen wasn't bad and was still high quality, but I found the dusty-ness of the dashi gave it a powdery texture that I didn't enjoy while the broth was overwhelmed and not allowed to shine. \\n\\nIn terms of components tonkotsu was also superior because the chashu were better than the clams. The chashus are thinly sliced and has a smoky flavor reminiscent of prosciutto but Japanese. It works very well with the soup. The egg was also great, well marinated and soft. The only ramen component I found lacking is the menwa but overall it was excellent! \\n\\nReally enjoyed our time\", \"Came here on a Saturday around 5:30pm without a reservation. We were offered seats at their community table where it was shared between 4 groups of 2, so we happily took that since the wait time was estimate to be an hour. The atmosphere is great with dim lights. Plus, you can see what's going on in the kitchen with their open space while seated at the community table. \\n\\nWe ordered the dipping noodles and the Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu. Both dishes were great. The broth for the dipping noodles was a little more on the oily side for me, so I added a bunch of sesame seeds and lemon juice that was provided. After our main dishes, we ended with the Mango Kaki-Gori which was delicious! Definitely share with another person at the very least, it is a large portion. We didn't get to try the banana pudding as everything else was very filling, but am looking forward to coming back to order more dishes and desserts!!\", \"Saw all the great reviews, so I made a reservation for two at the bar- this place is really solid and not over priced.\\n\\nWe got the classic tonkatsu ramen with their house spicy sauce in the side. The portion is just right to make someone full. The broth is amazing and the noodles are a nice chewy texture. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that the meat didn't really impress me. It didn't add to the ramen bowl at all, it was kind of dry.\\n\\nService was super quick, we were in and out of the restaurant within an hour. Ambiance is really nice and I can tell it's a popular spot so make a reservation!\", \"Came with a reservation and ordered lots of things to try! \\nI originally had their vegan ramen at the Williamsburg location but sad to say at this location it was not good. It tasted like a completely different dish. That's the main reason I brought my friend. Let down but we ordered a lot of things so it evened out the experience. \\nPotato crab salad, unagi rice ball, fried fish buns were all great. Mango shaved ice for dessert. Oh and their matcha lemonade is amazing. \\nWe were really really full! Service was quick and on point.\", \"Given that I'm not from Manhattan, the pricing is a bit higher than I'd normally expect for the type and portion of food ($20+ for something that would be probably $14 in my area). That said, they've repeatedly earned the Michelin Bib Gourmand award for good food at reasonable prices, so I'm sure the prices are more than reasonable if you're from the area. \\n\\nAll that said, the pricing certainly wouldn't keep me away. The sizes may have been a bit small, but the flavors were on point, the staff was super attentive and helpful, and they were able to be accommodating to us being early for our reservation. I would get the spicy tan tan again in a second, and the shaved ice desserts are a nice sharable dessert to end the meal. A nice light, sweet and refreshing palate cleanser. Definitely recommended, particularly the sharing aspect. It's big. \\n\\nThe only negative I can muster beyond my initial rant that really applies more to the city as a whole is that the bathroom line was rather long due to one of the two being out of order, but I'm sure that's temporary. \\n\\nDefinitely get a reservation. We had a lunch reservation, and were actually able to be seated a little early, but the line was out the door by the time we left.\", \"I got there just in time to get a spot without a reservation. I'd definitely recommend making one if you can. The wait quickly grew to over hour. \\n\\nUsually I'm not a fan of non alcoholic drinks, but I was really craving some green tea. I decided to give the matcha lemonade a try. It was fantastic! It tasted super fresh and sour in the best way. \\n\\nI had the Tan Tan Tonkatsu. The flavor was complex and the spice level was just right. \\n\\nI want going to get dessert, but I couldn't pass up the banana dessert. I'm born and raised in the south, so I've had quite the assortment of banana pudding, but this was absolutely the best banana pudding I've ever had. The texture with wafers at the bottom was perfect, and the caramelized crust on the banana was a nice touch. \\n\\nI wish they had more seating room, but it was definitely worth squeezing in.\", 'This restaurant is well deserving of their Michelin Star.  I came in during a weekday mid afternoon rush and was able to grab a community table seat.  The service was excellent, seamless with the tech they have to have you get situated.  \\n\\nI ordered the smoked dashi ramen, this soup had a deeper flavor than tonkotsu more intense, comes with some clams and other seafood ingredients to enhance the soup.  The downside of this bowl is that there is no chashu or your typical proteins that come with it, but I got a side of it to add to my ramen.  \\n\\nI also enjoyed the interior with the open face kitchen, you can see how they work to put your bowl together.  Great experience and food!', \"Came here for a late lunch on a Saturday. It's still packed at 3pm but we reserved a table. \\nI ordered the Tonchin classic and the broth is so good, doesn't taste greasy at all. The meat is sliced thin and flavorful as well.\\nIt's also reasonably priced. If you haven't tried ramen yet, this is the place to try it.\", \"Came here for lunch on a weekend and it was packed but was able to get seats at the bar. I would recommend getting a reservation if possible. We got the curry cheese wings to start off. The wings were delectably seasoned and slightly crispy. I could definitely taste some curry flavor but I wish there was more Parmesan as only the wings on top had any. I got the Tokyo ramen which had a wonderfully flavorful broth. I liked that it was lighter compared to other places. The noodles were springy and fresh. \\n\\nFor dessert, we got a Tokyo banana and mango kaki-gori. The banana dessert was heaven and I would highly recommend! The kaki-gori came in a larger size than anticipated which was great for sharing. There were also small dices of tart mango in the ice. \\n\\nThe service was attentive and efficient. We didn't have to wait long to get our next dish after finishing. The place gets pretty loud however and made it really hard to even hear someone sitting next to me. Aside from that, this was a great experience and look forward to trying their other offerings.\", \"This review is only for the matcha kakigori. \\n\\nThis shaved snow goodness of a dessert single-handedly makes Tonchin my happiest find of 2024. \\n\\nMy friend and I walked in just past 8pm on the last warm Sunday of the year. There are two tables by the entrance where people stand to wait for their seats. We ended up ordering from there and eating while standing. Nota bene: it takes quite a while to make this. \\n\\nSo. Worth. It. \\n\\nWhy this astounding snowball the size of a large child's head has to be served in a bowl with a diameter half the size of the dessert was beyond me, but I think it forces the eater to approach it carefully, which adds to the experience. It's as if you have to coax the tea-green kakigori to come onto your spoon and eventually into your mouth as delicately as it had been formed (how do you make something this fragile this big?). \\n\\nBut forget the physics. This thing defies many laws and the law of syrups is one of them. Syrups are often too much - clingy in both flavor and mouthfeel. But no sticky flavors here. The clean flavors of the syrup in this dessert is impeccable in that it allows you to eat this forever. I could seriously eat two of these myself without getting sick of its sweetness. It's not so sweet that you want to stop eating it but just sweet enough that you want to keep eating it, even with the anko (sweetened red bean paste) inside. The anko isn't overly sweet either but just sweet enough, layering its velveteen self onto the experience. And the cream on top is just that, bonus. Such creamy, delicious bonus.\\n\\nAll of this works because of the sheer amount of matcha in it. It's prevalent. It's pervasive. It's perfect. It's slightly sleep-preventing for people like me who get impacted by caffeine, but A) that's how you know they use the good stuff and B) a lot of it. But do it all over again and I'd still get this at 8pm. \\n\\nI hear the mango kakigori is also really good, but I don't know - I feel like it'd be really hard to beat this. I can't believe I'm saying this but this is the reigning top dessert in my book now. So the solution is: the next time I'm in NY, I will come here to order this - and order the mango one when I have 1/4 the bowl remaining. Then I can write another review.\", \"10/10 would recommend and eat here again! \\n\\nthis place has been awarded of Michelin Bib Gourmand from 2019-2023, hoping this year as well!\\nif you plan on checking this place out, i'd say make a reservation or go there early, because the inside is small and can only accommodate so many. It gets really busy and wait times can be as long as 2 hours. \\n\\nThe staff are very friendly, the inside is small, but clean and organized. \\nmenu is simple, nothing complicated, every easy to understand \\n\\nFood are amazingly delicious and affordable! My fave was tonkotsu ramen and the curry & cheese chicken wings! sooo delicious! \\ndrinks: i recommend the highball ume momo, and the sparkling momo\", \"Tonchin, a Michelin-starred establishment in Manhattan, offers an exceptional dining experience that lives up to its esteemed reputation. Reservations are essential due to its popularity, a testament to the restaurant's quality and demand.\\n\\nDuring a recent lunch visit with colleagues, we sampled a variety of dishes that showcased Tonchin's culinary prowess. We began with the Tebasaki Chicken Wings, which were expertly prepared - crisp exterior giving way to succulent meat within. The Fiji apple drink provided a refreshing counterpoint, its subtle sweetness balancing the savory notes of our meal.\\n\\nThe restaurant's signature dish, the Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu, exemplifies their mastery of traditional ramen. The homemade noodles possess an ideal texture, complemented by a rich, flavorful pork broth. The roasted chashu pork was remarkably tender, and the perfectly cooked egg added a luxurious touch to the bowl.\\n\\nHowever, the highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the Miso Ginger Ramen. This vegan offering demonstrates Tonchin's innovative approach to ramen, featuring a broth that is both complex and satisfying. The interplay of miso and ginger creates a depth of flavor that is truly remarkable, enhanced by the carefully selected toppings. It's worth noting that this dish is rumored to be instrumental in the restaurant's Michelin star acquisition, a claim that seems entirely plausible given its exceptional quality.\\n\\nThe ambiance at Tonchin strikes a balance between energetic and refined, reflecting the restaurant's popularity while maintaining an air of sophistication. Even with a reservation, patrons should be prepared for a short wait, which is a small price to pay for such an outstanding culinary experience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Tonchin stands out as a must-visit destination for discerning diners in New York City. Its commitment to quality ingredients, innovative recipes, and impeccable execution elevates it above many of its contemporaries in the competitive Manhattan dining scene. Whether you're a ramen enthusiast or simply appreciate fine cuisine, Tonchin offers a dining experience that is both memorable and deeply satisfying.\", \"Loved this place. Ramen is excellent. Came here after a Broadway show. Walked in and added our name to the list and was able to place our food order while waiting just before 10pm when their kitchen closed. By the time we were seated (9:50 or so) they had our appetizers already on the table. Rest of the food came out quickly, so it felt a little rushed. But can't complain about the food. \\n\\nThe classic Tokyo tonkatsu was excellent. Broth was so flavorful. Noodles were excellent. We also liked the tantan spicy ramen and shishito peppers. The gyozas were pretty good, but different from classic gyoza in how they were folded. The chicken bun was ok, would not get again for the price ($16 each??!). I would come back to try the maguro. Ambiance was good, it had mood lighting and was perfect for dinner.\", \"I made a reservation for lunch pretty far in advance, but it was worth it! The reservation is for 90 minutes starting from when you are seated at your table. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the chashu rice ball and smoked dashi ramen. The chashu rice roll is quite hefty and had a generous portion of bbq pork. I ordered the tsukemen. One of my absolute favorite tsukemen spots is located in LA and I came in with pretty high standards. I really liked the broth, but was not a huge fan of the chashu which sort of had the texture of lunch meat. I also wish there were more toppings such as bamboo shoots and bean sprouts. They use whole wheat thick noodles so the texture is a little more crumbly than what I was expecting, but made the dish a little lighter and balanced nicely with the rich broth. \\n\\nFinally, we concluded the meal with the mango kakigori. We were torn between all the great flavors, but mango was definitely the way to go. The tonchin honey cream lives rent-free in my mind. \\n\\nFood came out quickly so the 90 minutes felt appropriate. Prices were pretty standard as well. I wouldn't say the ramen was life-changing, but in combination with the kakigori I think it is worth trying at least once!\", \"We were craving a good bowl of ramen and decided to give Tonchin a try since they were Michelin star ramen for the past four years. They have two locations.  One in NYC and a second location in Brooklyn.\\n\\nI got the classic tonkotsu ramen.  The pork broth was thick, rich, and flavorful.  The chashu was paper thin.  I felt I was only eating a small bowl of noodles.\\n\\nThey were busy so we opted to sit at the bar.  Service was ok there.\\n\\nIt's quite pricey paying around $30 for a small bowl of ramen after tax and tip is factored in.  Sadly I won't be returning.  It's one and done.\", \"Delicious and affordable! The maguro was the star of the show for me. The garlic and the nuts added a great crunch and the flavors all blended together beautifully. My mouth was watering watching the waitress do the mixing of the sauce and the egg into the dish. \\n\\nThe dashi ramen was good but a tad salty for me and I wish there was more meat, but the noodles were thick and wavy and the broth was yummy (despite it being just a tiny too salty for me).\\n\\nEnergetic atmosphere (you do have to shout a little to talk) but clean and a fun vibe. Would def come back! Also noticed the bathroom is spacious and has a clean changing table for anyone who's also a mom!\", \"Food is amazing! I even finished all the soup  \\n\\nI usually felt like Japanese ramen is a bit salty for me. But this soup is perfect! I don't need to drink a pitcher of water after this. \\n\\nopen kitchen, the store area seems small but the seat space is big enough which I really like  \\n\\nHighly recommend to come here and try. If u can't get reservation online. Don't worry, just call them , lunch time, if they have seats, they still take walk in.\", \"Overall: rich rich rich broth that feels and tastes authentic. The service comes in a little bit mixed for me but I'm sure that's not the normal experience. \\n\\nFood: we tried the classic, the spicy tan tan, and the tsukemen. Every one of them was exactly as I was hoping for. Classic was rich traditional broth with slightly firmer noodles and a classic taste. The ramen eggs were also perfectly jammy and marinated. \\n\\nThe tan tan was spicy, heavier, and not too overpowering. They dollop a little bit of ground pork and a little bit of peanut flavor to give it that Chinese flavor. \\n\\nThe tsukemen sauce was light and refreshing to go with buckwheat noodle (would highly recommend this one for lighter palettes).\\n\\nMy only caveat is that the pork chashu left more to be desired. It looked like a deli meat with how grey and thing it was. Maybe it's their style but it did not look nor taste appetizing. \\n\\nAmbience/Decor/Service: now the service was a bit odd. We sat down and the waitress took a while to collect our order which for a Wednesday night was a bit confusing as it wasn't packed. They also have a lot of waiters/waitresses going around so it wasn't like they were understaffed. The real kicker was when we tried to pay for our meal having to wait a good 5-10 minutes. At a certain point we joked if we were allowed to just leave since they didn't want to take our money.\", 'I went to the location in midtown. It has a very nice yet understated decor. The service was great. Everyone was so nice and helpful. And if course the food was out of this world. I had the Tonchin classic Ramen. Delicious hearty broth, generous pieces of pork, and perfect firmness on the noodles. Even the soy egg was awesome. Highly recommend it.', \"Tonchin is pretty famous in NYC so I thought it would be hard to be seated. Luckily we were able to snag a reservation for 2 on the same day. Granted it was 9pm on a weekday. \\n\\nWe were seated right away and noticed how pretty and warm the vibe inside was. Definitely a good romantic and group spot! The waitress gave us recommendations and let us decide.\\n\\nWe weren't super hungry so we just got a ramen each. Both were amazing. The mazemen was creamy and rich. The flavors were shockingly delicate and addictive. The spicy tan tan is my ideal ramen, the texture of the noodles was perfect and the broth was creamy and rich. Initially I didn't mix my miso into the broth and the waitress came over to let me know that I had to. \\n\\nOverall we had a good experience and because we didn't indulge in anything other than the ramen our bill was very affordable too! \\n\\nBest ramen I've had in the city.\", 'Very crowded space. Service is good. Food is nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion. Must have a reservation and very difficult to make any changes. Not worth the hype', \"My friends and I decided to come here for dinner 2 weeks prior and didn't realize it was so hard to get reservations here! By the time we tried booking, there was only 8:45 PM or later and the place closes at 10 PM. I am picky with my ramen as I have tried many and only Ichiran has satisfied me, but I decided to give this place a try from all the good reviews I have seen.\\n\\nUpon arrival, we saw the place was popping! People have made reservations but were still waiting outside and in the inside waiting area. After about 15 minutes, we were seated at a booth. The place was surprisingly dark and did not house a lot of people, but it was relatively loud. My friends and I decided to share an appetizer and we went with the Tebasaki chicken wings. The chicken wings did not disappoint! It was flavorful and delicious. As for ramen, we each othered our own and different ones ranging from the Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkatsu, Spicy Tan Tan, and Smoked Dashi. The ramen was flavorful and good! Better than A LOT of ramen places out there. \\n\\nLastly, my favorite thing of all is the mango kaki-gori. It's like a gigantic shaved ice with mango pieces and flavoring topped with honey cream. I am a huge dessert person and I think one portion is meant to be shared amongst 3 to 4 people, especially after a whole bowl of soup noodles. LOVED everything and will definitely come back!\\n\\nFYI - The restaurant has two unisex and spacious restrooms that smells like lavender.\", \"Fantasic ramen! I was in NYC for the weekend and heard great things about Tonchin, but not so great about the lines outside. Got here at about 11:30 am and walked right in getting a seat at the bar. \\n\\nThe ramen was superb. Ordered the classic Tonchin. Amazing bold and broth, but not overly fatty or greasy (I hate when ramen places overdo it with fat and salt). The noodles were long, chewy, and masterfully crafted. The tonkatsu was so tender and flavorful. It was also not sliced overly thick, which is also a pet peeve of mind. The thickness of the sliced pork was perfect.\\n\\nOverall I had an amazing experience. Service was friendly and attentive. Food was outstanding. Highly deserving of it's Bib Gourmand rating!\", \"Food: 3.5-4\\nService: 5\\nValue: 3.5\\nOverall: 4\\n\\nTonchin is a great place to get a bowl of ramen and probably one of the better options in the city. However, considering it's hard to get a reservation, a bit on the pricier end, and while good the ramen definitely doesn't blow away with flavor...wouldn't say it is a clear 5/5 for me, but I'd come back (originally went in August and then again in September)\", \"It's best to make reservations. Tonchin has a lively atmosphere. Great service. Really great flavorable food. \\nThe maguro was prepared at the table which was fun. The cashews added a little crunch, amplifying the tuna mixture. You eat the mixture by wrapping it in lettuce and seaweed.\\nThe spicy tan tan ramen was the right amount of spice in my opinion. The meat was super tender. It was delicious.\\nI finished my dinner with mango kaki-gori. This ice dessert is refreshing. You have to get to the bottom to get to the mangoes that are cut into little cubes. It can definitely feed two to four people.\", \"Definitely need a res here or you'll be waiting awhile. Wasn't too hard to book. I think I booked a couple days before. Got the smoked dashi ramen which comes with clam. Something I've never had before but would definitely get again. The broth was super flavorful and not too heavy. I really enjoyed the ramen. Fried fish baoz were great as well. Super crunchy and flavorful.

I am still dreaming about the miso ginger ramen. It has the right amount of zing from the ginger balanced with the rich miso creating flavors that are both bold and refreshing. The noodles are perfectly cooked and each sip of the broth is warm and comforting. Ingredients are so fresh, I devoured my entire bowl. The vibes in the restaurant are dark and sexy. I loved the dim lighting and intimate atmosphere. The service was great throughout the night. We sat at the bar and it was filled with people. Overall Tonchin was a 10/10 experience and I can't wait to come back!\", \"some of the best ramen i've had in the city!! \\n\\ngot the chicken wings which were perfectly dry fried and crispy, spicy tan tan ramen which was spicy, creamy and a little nutty, and the mango ice dessert which was amazing with the cream (not too sweet)!!\\n\\nloved that the chashu pork was thin and tender but didn't live the thick bamboo. overall a really good ramen spot!!\", \"Came here with my friends, weren't able to get a reservation but luckily we came early enough that the wait wasn't too bad, was about 45 min wait and the server said that's actually really good because it was a slow night for them. Not sure what slow means because it definitely didn't look slow. The place was locked and bustling. Even though, there server was very friendly, attentive and quick. The place isn't that big but roomy enough not to be on top of each other and had nice comfortable booths. \\n\\nWe had the smoked dashi ramen, spicy tantan, and vegetarian ginger. All were really good! I had a green lemonade to drink and it was amazing! It was culinary grade matcha with lemonade. Sounds simple but tasted very complex. Finished the night with coffee shaved ice. All very very good. No complaints! \\n\\nFor appetizers we had chili edamame, cucumber salad,peppers and mushrooms. All were excellent! Especially the sauce for the cucumber salad. One of my friends drank it from the bowl!\", 'Food was amazing! Got the spicy tan tan and loved every bite! Will go back again to try another ramen! Will definitely get the Eel appetizer again.', \"somehow we managed to get a table of 4 with no wait and no res  i think the ramen is good nothing life-altering. ramen is not one of my favorite foods so unfortunately i don't have the same passion as i would for other foods but i recognize this ramen was above average taste wise. the gyoza was very mid so i would skip on that unless u love gyoza and need it with every meal. wish i ordered the lunch set but i was not feeling too hungry would have loved to try the buns!\", 'This was amazing 10/10\\nIf you love a mild spice this is for you!!\\nThe music they play is so fun and adds to the experience.']}, {'id': 'ehUuSk5gPTCQmwS_ubgKRA', 'name': 'Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V3pVDPhGZdbBueIMxkc8uw/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'http://www.upstatenyc.com', 'display_address': '95 1st Ave', 'display_phone': '(646) 791-5400', 'rating': 4.4, 'reviews': ['this place is good for a casual night dinner and drink. sat at the bar and had amazing experience with the bartender. staff is super chill and accommodating.', \"5/5 happy hour deal, 3/5 entrees \\n\\nStopped by last minute for Saturday night dinner with my parents. Made a reservation right before arriving, but it wasn't necessary. The tables were filed but turnover was quick. We got 2 happy hour deals which is $12 for 6 oysters and a beer. The oysters tasted fresh and the beers were great. We also ordered the seafood pasta, surf and turf, and fried crab. The steak was probably the best part. The fried crab was interesting but need some more flavor underneath the fried layer, and the pasta needed some more salt. Would come back just for the happy hour though! Vibes are fun, upbeat music and lively chatter\", \"Overall: This was a last minute place that I went to on a friday night with my girlfriend.  There were plenty of reservations available - it seems like this place gets most packed for their happy hour deals.  Most of the food was great except for one bad experience with the mussels.

Everything was fantastic except the mussels.  We actually sent the mussels back.  They were grainy, tasted like they weren't fresh, and were overall terrible.  Unfortunately this offset the other food that we really enjoyed.  In particular, we enjoyed the Acadia oysters and the Squid Ink Pasta.  Our waiter made it right and took the mussels off our bill, but they were unfortunate at best.\\n\\nDrinks: We got a couple rounds of their beers.  The draught menu isn't that extensive, but theres a little bit of everything and beers are $7.\\n\\nService:  Our waiter saved our experience.  He was prompt, helpful, and very understanding about the issue with the mussels.  \\n\\nValue:  For a seafood / raw bar, this place was definitely on the cheaper side.  We've heard good things about the happy hour and will definitely be back for that.\\n\\nAtmosphere: This was a fun place to go but it was very loud.  At points we had to shout to hear each other.  It wasn't particularly crammed full of tables, but noise seemed to reverberate.\", \"This isn't the first time dining here, they have good happy hour combo of oysters with beer from 5-7pm (M-Sun). If oyster isn't your kind of taste, they have great beer options reasonably priced. Their entrees are also delicious and good portion. There's always a wait, so be sure to reserve in advance!\", \"I absolutely loved coming here for happy hour! I got one glass of wine + 6 oysters for $16 which is an incredible deal, wondering a lot of restaurants charge that much for wine alone. My friend and I also split the squid ink/uni pasta which was quite buttery and tasty, with a nice pop from the trout roe. \\n\\nThe only issue I had was the slow service, I think there was only one guy shucking oysters for the whole restaurant so it took about 45 min for our oysters to come out. I did want to order another round but decided it wasn't worth the wait. Hopefully the restaurant can staff more during happy hour.\", \"For more details on why I love this place so much, please read my previous reviews.

It's been a long time since we've visted, but I'm glad to see they're thriving. \\n\\nMy husband and I came here on a Friday night. Thank God we made a reservation, because at 6pm, it was packed! We made it in time for the oyster happy hour, which is one of the city's best deals. But the star of our meal was the squid ink and uni pasta! We've been to some of the top pasta spots in the city and this dish rivals them! The pasta was perfect cooked and the sauce was rich and tasty. The uni gave it enough umami to keep you wanting more. Next time, I'm getting my own and not sharing with my husband lol.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and Shane was so attentive to us. He made sure our glasses were never empty and we had a great conversation. It's great to see an owner take pride in their business and it really shows that Shane cares about this place.\\n\\nI will make sure come back often!\", \"We me up a friend that lives in NYC and we had a hankering for some seafood after drinking some tropical drinks in the neighborhood.  The alfresco seating was the perfect setting we were looking for that night.\\n\\nI had the squid ink pasta and loved every bite. It was perfectly cooked, with a rich uni flavor that I couldn't get enough of. We also tried the West Coast oysters, and they were out of this world--fresh, perfectly shucked, and incredibly flavorful. The staff's recommendations for craft beer pairings were spot on, and the rotating taps had an impressive mix craft brews and unique finds, making it a beer lover's paradise.\\n\\nService was awesome. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and it was clear they had a genuine passion for the menu. I was amazed at how he was able to navigate the busy bike path between our table and the restaurant without getting run over.  \\n\\nAll in all, Upstate Craft Beer and Oyster Bar went above and beyond my expectations. It's a fantastic spot for a casual night out, a special occasion, or just to enjoy some of the best oysters and craft beer in the city. Can't wait to come back!\", 'Great find in the East village.

Happy Hour seems like a good deal @ $12 for 6 oysters and a beer but our oysters were nottt the freshest, and weren't served as cold as they could be. Varieties were just not tasty. I'm partial to West coast but have had plenty of great ones from the East recently so I wasn't tooo biased. \\n\\nWe didn't receive any mignonette or cocktail sauce. We use both sparingly so we didn't mind only lemon wedges but still, would have been nice to be included. The burrata was not a high quality ball; my partner hated the whole dish. I had the Fish of the Night which was a Branzino filet. SAVED THE NIGHT. The meaty piece was perfectly cooked in shrimp stock, so tender with a robust pesto and simple but complimentary zucchini bits. I could have licked the plate clean. \\n\\nOur cocktails were disappointments, though. Margarita was too smoky and almost sour even though it had watermelon. My bf thought the martini was just ok! \\nUpstate has dive bar vibes where you may have to yell across the table (noise was exacerbated by the rowdy group that were all standing around us.) \\nNot inherently a problem but didn't realize that was the atmosphere! Would not bring more than a group of 4 people as it's incredibly intimate. \\n\\nGreat area for bar hopping and small eats, too!\", 'Small, dark space with a great selection of beers and oysters.

I can not brag enough about the delish this place is.  The only thing when is gets busy the service lacks. But overall this spot has a special place in my heart', 'We came here for HH oysters but were actually pretty impressed by the food too! They have deals to do the oysters with wine instead of beer for those who prefer wine. My friend and I shared the Tuna Tartare and Squid Ink Pasta with Uni. Both were actually delicious. My only complaint was that the bread that came with the Tuna Tartare was a little hard/stale. Other than that, great spot :)', 'Have been coming here for 7+ years and are beyond pleased every time. Always love the happy hour (beer, oysters) & our favorite dish, fettuccine w clams. We both get it every time!', \"One would not expect such upscale food to be served in a casual bar atmosphere, but there you have it! Every dish tasted acutely reminded me of Michelin starred restaurants that I've tried, from the amuse-bouche proffered, to the crab cake appetizer, to the surf and turf entree, through to the unique whisky pound cake dessert served. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and my wallet was quite happy at the affordable price point. Additionally, the service was outstanding. We were graciously attended to multiple times by the owner/manager himself. Always a telling sign of high quality. Do note that this is a small space so surrounding conversations can get a bit loud, so focus on your food and drink and you'll be thoroughly content. Lastly, bring cash to avoid the 2.9% credit card fee.\", 'Their food is unbeatable at this price point -- under $20 you can get a full satisfying plate of fresh mussels that were purged well, or a cream pasta with delicious clams and lots of umami, or a bunch of oysters sourced from local fisheries (during happy hours). Plus attentive but not intrusive service and excellent bar ambiance...What else could you ask for?? Hands down my favorite oyster/seafood bistro in town.', 'Upstate Craft Beer & Oyster Bar is the perfect place to enjoy a dozen oysters and grab a cozy seat at their bar. The staff are so personable and make you feel right at home. The ambiance is warm and welcoming making it such a wonderful neighborhood favorite in the East Village. They have a great oyster happy hour and we cannot wait to visit this gem again!', \"I finally had the chance to stop by Upstate and it was well worth the wait! Initially, my plan was to have oysters and go home. I took a seat at the bar just after they opened. Their $12 special for a half dozen oysters and a beer (or wine for +$4) is a good deal. The oysters available for HH are bolded on a list of their other whole oyster selection. I went with 2 of each of the 3 on special and a glass of vinho verde. The oysters were fresh and briny.\\n\\nAs I sat at the bar listening to their great Pandora selections, I looked at the rest of the menu and decided to stay a little longer. Many things caught my eye, ensuring a future return, but the scallops of the day captured my heart. They were served atop a bed of sauteed spinach and a carrot puree, with prosciutto butter sauce. When I say amazing...I mean it. I could eat the puree in a bowl by itself. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Nicely seasoned and a perfect sear. Spinach is not my favorite vegetable but it was prepared very well here, where it wasn't mushy as spinach can be. The whole dish was just so good. And very reasonably priced, as my entree was $21. I'm looking forward to going back to try more of the menu!\", \"Was having a girls night Saturday night and was craving some oysters. I've had my eye on this spot for the longest and finally got to come here. Honestly would say one of the best oyster spots in Manhattan! \\n\\nI ordered the escargot (snails) and oysters. Never had snails before and it tasted amazing. It was dipped in an olive oil/basil base which gave it great flavor. The type of oysters I had were recommended to me by the server and they were very delicious. \\n\\nService and staff was very sweet to us and even offered free bread and dessert for us to snack on. \\n\\nThe place can get lively and booked so PLEASE get a reservation to be safe.

There's a nice dimly lit little bar area, high-top tables, 2-4 person tables, and space outside if the weather's nice (and those food sheds are your thing).\\n\\nHappy hour goes past six, which is much appreciated. The option is for six oysters and then either beer for $12 or wine for $16. The oysters available as part of the special are from MD (Chesapeake Bay) and VA. My friend and I split the oysters and got individual beers, from which they have a large selection ranging from chocolatey to fruity hints. This was definitely worth the price for me. Also, our waitress was great and gave us a few beers to sample to help us decide.\\n\\nI got lucky as this first time ever trying oysters. My friend walked me through the tutorial due to me not being able to properly eat it in one go. While I'm still debating whether I liked the taste or not, I think the restaurant did everything right. The three dipping sauces were great, I especially liked the garlic butter one.  \\n\\nI wish they had more things on the menu that weren't seafood based as I didn't want to have two seafood-based things at once. Also, I was still hungry post oysters, because while it's fun to play with your food it's not too filling. It is a great place for an app and some drinks. Complimentary whiskey bread at the end is also a fun surprise\", \"Came with a reservation for 2 on a Saturday evening and was sat outdoors. \\n\\nClam fettuccine- the pasta was quite dry and lacking flavor, but the clams were meaty/juicy and carried the flavor in this dish\\n\\nShark & shrimp mash- a new item on the menu. Never had shark before so was curious to try it. The shark was flaky but didn't have much taste, I'd recommend squeezing the half lemon to give that extra zing/acidity. The shrimp mash was so good & buttery accompanied by baby shrimp with each bite. Pretty balanced dish with the asparagus included.\\n\\nThey gave us a complimentary slice of whiskey cake at the end which was nice. The cake tasted more like pound cake with a whiskey brush, but nonetheless still good. \\n\\nWaiters were attentive and came to check on us periodically. Only thing with outdoor seating is that it's quite noisy with the cars going by.\", 'Great oyster and beer happy hour deal!! \\n\\nThe happy hour was $12 - 6 oysters and a beer (or wine they said). The meat on the oyster was on the smaller side, but they order fresh from the market each day. There is no freezer at the restaurant!! \\n\\nThe surf and turf was very solid. The steak was juicy. I had asked for medium, but some pieces were a little rare. There were also some potatoes that were perfectly crispy, but was not consistent throughout. \\n\\nMy friend said the bone marrow was too oily for her and definitely need more bread to go with it. I told her bone marrow is naturally rich and fatty, but she said it was even more so than usual. \\n\\nThe service was good.

It sucks because I actually enjoyed the food but because of the service I\\'ll never come back. \\n\\nWe had a reservation at 6 and got there at 6:05. Reservations clearly don\\'t matter here because we had to wait 10 minutes for our table. The couple in front of us who also had a reservation at 6 were still waiting because they reserved the balcony while we were getting seated. Although this is something I wouldn\\'t have even minded because I get that it gets busy and you can\\'t always time things correctly. \\n\\nWhat really pissed me off was after we initially ordered our oysters, wine, and entrees we wanted to get another drink. Our waitress was outside talking so I just flagged down the first waiter that walked by. He responded to me \"Not for me\". Okay one rude waiter doesn\\'t make a whole establishment. I tried to flag down the next waiter that walked by and he looked at me and just ignored me and walked right past me. Then I see the first waiter I tried to flag down and asked him \"If you can\\'t take my order, can you bring my waitress?\" and once again he walked away and did not bring the waitress. After all of this goes down the hostess comes up to us and asks if we would mind moving tables to the high chairs (I think because they had a bigger party coming in and once again they don\\'t plan out these reservations well enough). I explained to her what happened and I most definitely will not be moving tables after everyone I\\'ve tried to flag down has straight up ignored me. I\\'m sorry you want me to do you a favor when I can\\'t even order another glass of wine?

The food is delicious, I especially love the scallops!', \"We revisited this restaurant after a long time and it's clearly improved. My husband and I had a pleasant evening dining here last Friday. We enjoyed the oyster happy hour, which offers great value, and the standout dish was definitely the squid ink and uni pasta. Shane, the owner, served us at the bar and his attention to detail made our experience even better. It's nice to see such dedication in running a place.\", \"I had a lovely meal here while visiting NYC.  It definitely has a neighborhood vibe, with solid oysters, and very good food. I ended up at the counter, having a fun conversation with whom I believe was the owner, and a frequent patron.

I only had maybe 10 large ones out of 24\\n- Service was poor, waiter was not attentive and did not provide recommendations for the menu\\n- Because I ordered two of each.

I recommend making a reservation since they are a small place and do fill up quickly\", 'I went to this place for happy hour and arrived at 5:05 hoping to sit at the bar. However, the hostess informed me that I needed my husband, who was running about 15 minutes late, to be present before I could be seated and asked me to wait outside. Additionally, I was told that I must leave by 6:15pm. \\n\\nSensing the situation, I immediately booked a 5:15pm slot, considering the restaurant was completely empty and slots were readily available every 15 minutes. When I returned and mentioned my reservation, the hostess inquired if I would like to order before my husband arrived, which was my intention for happy hour anyway. Eventually, she ALLOWED me to enter.\\n\\n Interestingly, ten minutes later, two white gentlemen walked in without any hindrance or questions. While I adore this place for its food and happy hour offerings, the actions of one person completely marred my experience. What a shame..', \"UCBOB is simply reliable. The menu is short and simple but it does not miss. The beer selection rotates frequently and the food is consistently excellent. Plus, it's cozy, cool, the service is great, and reservations online are a breeze.\\n\\nIt has earned my trust so much, l recently brought my very-allergic-to-shellfish friend here for dinner. (Relax, his wife is a doctor; we had an epipen; no one's life was endangered). \\n\\nThough he seemed skeptical at first, two bites into his Surf and Turf (he substituted a portion of the salmon for the prawns), he was won over. His wife told us that the Fettucine with Clams was the best she's had in New York. By the end of the meal, we all full stomachs and pictures of three different beers on our phones to look up later. I'd call that a smashing success. \\n\\nIn case you're undecided, I'll also recommend the Bone Marrow with Baby Bay Scallops. The bone marrow is phenomenal, just absolutely packed with flavor. But like I said, you can't go wrong. \\n\\nI would not take a friend with a seafood allergy to many seafood restaurants. But this place is exceptional.\", \"This place is so GOOD!!!!! Been here a bunch of times both sober and drunk and EVERY times has been AMAZING. \\n\\nThey used to have scallop with risotto and their risotto was my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE, so i'm super sad it's not there anymore. They still have the scallops but I think it's on a bed of asparagus. \\n\\nHonestly, everything here is soooo good. They start you off with an oyster list, usually around 2-3$ an oyster and they've always been pretty juicy regardless of what i order. I think they have a happy hour, but i've never been around that time. \\n\\nThe crab cakes are a bit spicy, but if you're into crab cakes like me, you'll enjoy them. \\n\\nThe fettuccine with clam is also DELICIOUS. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure because the noodles are OOOOZING with garlic and butter (in the best way). \\n\\nBone Marrow also A++++. I liked the way they laid this dish out. You essentially use the bone marrow with crackers and this beautiful Greek(?) yogurt-like sauce. It's so tasty! I like that they made it into finger food so the bone marrow isn't too overwhelming.\\n\\nI think we've had all the octupus dishes and they are pretty solid too. The only thing I'd say i didn't enjoy was the ceviche here, i think it didn't taste super fresh to me for some reason. \\n\\nOTHERWISE, the menu here is PERFECT. They serve drinks and beer and I find the drinks here to be pretty strong. The line/wait here can get quite long, especially on weekends for dinner. I'd HIGHLY recommend putting your name on the yelp waitlist ~30-40mins before coming. We had a subway delay issue and we're late to our waitlist spot, but I called them and they were super nice about it. We were seated immediately after getting to the restaurant. \\n\\nI LOVEEEEEEEEEE upstate! it's such a nice date spot and just has so many solid dishes!\", \"THE hangout spot for oyster-lovers! Great happy hour deals, $12 for 6 oysters (3-types to choose from) + beer; $19 for wine. I came with a party of 4 and tried the rose and vesper martini -- solid options. Drinks paired well with the food we ordered. I got the bone marrow with baby scallops and the flavors were excellent. Squid ink pasta was also really good. A lot of other guests ordered it, assuming its a fan favorite. Portion-size is decent but definitely the type where you can use a bit more food/snack after a solid hour or two of chatting.\\n\\nI usually have a hard time finding good crab crakes but its pretty well-made here. Moist but won't fall apart if you break it into smaller bite-size pieces (they come in twos). Not a fan of the tuna tartare. There was a minty aftertaste and the overall bite had a very fishy (not fresh) taste that kind of just sat on my tongue and was hard to get rid of. Not sure if its suppose to taste like that or I'm just not a fan of the combination. Overall atmosphere of the place was great!! 8/10 recommend!\", 'I always saw people post upstate oyster bar and I would crave oysters, so I decided to invite my friends and go for happy hour. It was a disappointing experience. \\n\\n1) There was no option of having 1 dozen oysters, the waitress gave us a list of oysters and it had random names on it, I asked her what each name meant and she said \"I have no idea.\" Great. I decided to order 1 of each on the list so that was about 14 oysters, when she brought out the oysters, I clearly counted only 12, so I asked her which one she was missing, once again, she had no clue. The oysters themselves were decent but again, I had no clue what I was eating!\\n\\n2) The bone marrow scallop dish was good, but the portions were really small for that price. However, if you had to get something here, I would suggest the bone marrow dish. The scallops could be salted a bit more.\\n\\n3) The squid ink pasta with sea urchin - absolute disappointment. It was flavorless, the sea urchin wasn\\'t fresh and the portion was extremely small.\\n\\nOverall food is about 4/10 and service was 2/10. Would not recommend visiting this place!', \"Pretty expensive for bad service and average food. I wouldn't recommend. The street seating had no heat either.\", 'My boyfriend and I love upstate.

Careful of the slippery floors\", \"Spicy Pork Chop Soup is a very tasty dish! It's big enough for 2 to 3 people. Don't order it if you don't eat spicy food. The fried luncheon meat was the food I ordered and I loved this. My friend ordered nori rolls which I tried and it was also very good.\\n\\nI can't pick any other faults except the price is a bit expensive! I will be coming back again.\", 'Came here with my boyfriend, friend and her husband and had a good time. The place is large, has plenty of seating, is a beautiful and clean spot. I wish their korean bbq wings were a little better but my friend said it was an \"off day\" and I believe her. I want to go back and try again. The food was really good dont get me wrong, just not the best wings. Try the fried spam; I NEVER eat spam but my friend made me try a bite and it was a pleasant surprise. \\n\\nFood came out quick and it was reasonably priced, if not a deal/steal!', \"First off, I made a mistake because the ambiance and the vibes for this place is definitely for friends who want to get some drinks and talk. With that being said, I went with my family and we ate family style! My family has all sorts of allergens and food preferences, so it was pretty tough to get food for everyone, but we made it work! We got an abundance of food and honestly they were all pretty good. I think the only thing bad about it was the price. The service was pretty good but could be better. The ambiance was unfair for us to judge because we just didn't know any better. We were also a party of 5 so they charged gratuity and expected tips as well. I still rate it a 5/5 regardless.\", \"I've passed by the entrance to Anytime Kitchen quite a few times on the way to the karaoke spot upstairs, and have always commented to friends how it smells good and that I wanted to try sometime... well last night was the golden opportunity for my partner and I!\\n\\nStepping in fairly early on a Saturday and it was packed, so we knew we would be in for a treat. Sitting down and looking at the menu (which was online), we were pleased to see a buy 2, get 1 free deal. We picked those 3 items, and one additional (everything looked sooooo good) along with a bottle of rice wine which was delicious. While all the food was delicious, the fried pork kalbi was both out favorite dish. \\n\\nVibe is chill and casual, service quick. Prices very reasonable. We already started gameplanning our order for the next time we come, which is VERY rare for us as we try to avoid repeating restaurants. Would absolutely recommend to others!\", \"This restaurant is on the third floor of an inconspicuous stairway in the middle of Ktown so it is pretty easy to miss. We made a reservation on a Thursday night to be safe but it wasn't necessary. The place wasn't completely packed but there was a good amount of turnover and new customers coming in. The hostess was also able to move our party of 2 to a table of 4 because the table wasn't big enough to hold all the food we ordered.\\n\\nThe BBQ pork belly came out first on a portable heater and was a great start to the meal. The creamy ramyun was our favorite dish of the night. The spicy chicken tteokbokki was a little bit too spicy for me but it was delicious none the less. The pork kalbi was okay, but definitely not a must try.\\n\\nAll in all this was a great place to grab some dinner and chat over some food and drinks. The atmosphere was suitable for conversation without being too loud or rowdy. Food was good, staff was nice, would recommend.\", \"Anytime Kitchen in NYC is a true hidden gem for those seeking quick, affordable Korean food. And I do mean hidden--it's tucked away on the third floor of a building, and it took us a bit of effort to find and walked by it the first time. But once I did, it was absolutely worth it. The prices are unbeatable, making it perfect for students or anyone on a budget in NYC. \\n\\nThe food leans more toward casual Korean fast food, so don't expect gourmet fare, but it's perfect for a quick, satisfying meal. The atmosphere is laid-back with plenty of seating, even for those with baby strollers. The drinks were fun and strong, adding a nice touch to the experience!\\n\\nHowever, the service had its hiccups. They accidentally gave a few of our dishes to another table, and when things got busier, the main lights were dimmed, which threw off the vibe a bit. To top it off, we were almost overcharged by over $100. They had a deal where you buy 2 or 3 dishes and get 1 free, but they charged us for all the dishes--and even tacked on an extra soju bottle, even though the server had promised it as compensation for the delay. They also said we would get a discount if we paid in cash but forgot to include it in our final bill. \\n\\nDespite the miscommunication and mishaps, the staff was friendly and accommodating--they just seemed overwhelmed when it got busy. Overall, I'd give it another shot the next time I'm in NYC!\", \"This place was cool. It's located in Koreatown in New York City. We made reservations for 6 o'clock and it was a little empty but 30 minutes after the place was crowded. The service was great.

We got the royal soup, spicy pork, and bulgogi fries. We would skip the fries next time. Its also a bit hard to find, make sure you go up the stairs! My friend and I sat down at the wrong restaurant at first.', \"We love Anytime Kitchen! \\n\\nThe location feels like an (open) secret, which starts your meal with the same sort of illicit vibe that you get when you go into a modern speakeasy. The restaurant is three floors up from the street, and you get in by climbing a narrow staircase that begins past the endless line for Wonjo. You have a reservation upstairs, so no waiting in that nonsense. \\n\\nOnce you get inside, you're in a super fun Korean Anju spot. Order some Soju and scan for the menu. Honestly, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. \\n\\nOver several visits, we tried the Truffle Jjajang Ramyun Noodles, the Super Creamy Tteokbokki, Bulgogi Fries, Popcorn Chicken, and a Pork Shoulder BBQ which were all fantastic. The Kimchi Okonomiyaki was delicious, the Kimchi Cream Ramyun Noodles were creamy and a little spicy and then more Soju! \\n\\nService has been quite good, considering how busy Anytime Kitchen is. It didn't seem to matter if we were at a two top or at one of the bigger group tables in the back of the room, the food came out quickly and we never felt rushed. \\n\\nI could see this place also being great for a private party.\", \"This place is located in ktown. I came after work and they weren't too busy so we got seated pretty quickly. The staff was efficient and nice. This seemed like a fun and casual place to hang out after work. \\n\\nWe ordered the pork belly, corn cheese, cheese spicy chicken tteokbokki as part of a special they are running where you order 2 entrees and get a free appetizer. The pork belly was cooked perfectly with a crispy sear but was still juicy and tender. The corn cheese was a classic appetizer that you can't go wrong with. The cheese spicy chicken tteokbokki was cheesy, flavorful and a wonderful choice!\\n\\nI would def recommend trying this place out!\", 'This is such a fun place to be.

We came on an early Friday night when it wasn't very busy. We started off with a bottle of peach makgeolli and this is where it all went wrong. 20 minutes after ordering when our food was arriving, our drink hadn't arrived yet and we had to ask for it. Someone went to get it and gave it to the table next to us instead of us. We finally got it and it wasn't cold.  We asked for a cold one and the waitress just disappeared  with it. We started eating and were about halfway through our meal, and our drink still wasn't back. The waitress said they were making it cold and went to get it for us. We weren't sure how they were going to make it cold in 10 minutes... and no surprise it didn't get cold in 10 minutes. So we asked for some ice, and we got pushback because she said the drink was cold! We basically had to demand for ice, and we're finally able to get it. Very frustrating when all we wanted was a cold drink to go with our food. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the food was great, the octopus and pork belly stir fry was nicely seasoned and the Kimchi jigae broth was flavorful. The fried pork Kalbi was a bit bready and just seemed to be some edges of meat that were battered to cover what was actually under it. It was free because of the 2 for 1 promotion they have going on now, but I'm not sure I would get it for $28.\", \"10/10 this is one of the places I am dying to eat at every time I visit.

The food is delicious and in small portions that make you want to order seconds. Both my friend and I ordered the lychee cocktail. He wanted vodka in his, which was a $3 extra charge. When the waiter came over with our order, he said \"this one has no alcohol.\" We thought he meant as in there is no vodka in mine, but it was apparently made virgin. It definitely did not taste like there was any soju in it at all, but it was still delicious.', \"This place is so much fun and one of my favorites in ktown :) It's like a hidden gem, and serves some delicious and flavorful tapas. This place has soo many vegetarian options and something for everyone. \\n\\nI used to order the creamy udon but decided to switch it up and try the tteokbokki and the veggie japchae and it was next level amazing. \\n\\nThe tteokbokki was SOO flavorful and cheesy and sweet.

We ordered the 2+1 special - order two \"main dishes\" and you get 1 appetizer for free.\\n\\nUnfortunately I have to knock off three stars for the absolute abysmal service and attitude that we got from one of the service staff. I saw two of the window tables open up and asked him if we could switch there, but he asked me if I had a reservation and when I said I didn\\'t, he rudely brushed me off. I then asked the server next to him and she said yeah it was fine to move to the window table. Later, we placed order for alcohol and had to WALK UP TO HIM multiple times to ask him where our alcohol was. People around us were getting their alcohol and even tables that had just arrived. Eventually (40 minutes later), he brought it out to us, but I think that was because the manager was there.\\n\\nSo the moral of the story is if you get that dude as your server, don\\'t accidentally piss him off somehow or he\\'ll retaliate.', \"Okay future Rae - you ate here on a Tuesday and made reservations even though it wasn't necessary on the weekday. \\n\\nYes it's trendy and nicely placed on the second floor but I mean - the prices and food were not matched. \\n\\nWe ordered the spicy kimchi stew, pork belly (bossam), seaweed rice rolls, shishito peppers, and a side of kimchi. I was kinda shocked that their banchan (just the kimchi) was a chargeable item. Maybe I was expecting a different vibe. \\n\\nI felt like the food itself was okay - a little expensive for what it was and I still felt hungry after we left. \\n\\nThe service and atmosphere was fun and cool but for the food? I think I'd check somewhere else for future outings!\", \"This spot is truly something special, offering an entirely fresh and innovative approach to combining Korean and American flavors. From the moment you walk in, you can tell this isn't your typical dining experience. One of the highlights for me was the self-cooking KBBQ--it's not just about the food, it's about the experience. There's something so fun and engaging about grilling your own meats right at the table while you catch up with friends. It really makes the meal feel interactive and memorable.\\n\\nWe also had the chance to try a variety of their fusion tapas, and each dish exceeded expectations. Every plate was thoughtfully crafted, showcasing a perfect blend of bold flavors and unique ingredients. You can tell the chef is really passionate about balancing tradition with creativity.\\n\\nAnd let's talk about the drinks--wow! The premium soju cocktails are definitely one of the standouts here. They aren't just your typical cocktails; they're elevated in a way that makes the drinking experience just as exciting as the food. Each drink was expertly crafted with a perfect balance of smoothness and kick.\\n\\nBut the real star for me was the Ko-Merican burger. This burger is a fusion masterpiece--combining the best of American comfort food with Korean twists that make it absolutely unforgettable. The flavors are so unique, and the patty itself is perfectly juicy and full of flavor.\\n\\nOverall, everything about this place is a testament to how food culture can evolve and adapt in creative, exciting ways. It's a wonderful mix of flavors, fun, and innovation that sets it apart from anything else in the area.

The popcorn tofu has sweet and spicy glaze over the deep fried tofu and it was very good. The sauce was tangy and the tofu was fried perfectly. The truffle fries was maybe my favorite dish. It was so crispy. The 4 pieces of chicken and veggie gyoza with soy sauce had good filling and fried well. The smoked pork belly had good sauce and I enjoyed the shaved cabbage. The assorted Korean pancakes stew was kept hot on a burner and had a mix of seafood. It was very good. All the food was great for sharing. We had limited space on our tables so we needed to combine some leftovers. \\n\\nMy friends and I had a wonderful time at Anytime Kitchen. I'm glad we arrived when we did. There is a cash discount if you pay in cash. Service was absolutely wonderful and friendly. They were very attentive.

The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor and the door is easy to miss (no sign). It also slams really loud and it is quite annoying if you sit near it. First impression of the restaurant was not so great. Despite the exterior not being the safest, the inside of the restaurant feels very welcoming and has views of the bustling Ktown. Anytime Kitchen is more of a casual Korean restaurant that offers comfort dishes.\\n\\nPopcorn Chicken - A very delicious appetizer. The chicken was crispy and coated with sweetened gochujang sauce.\\n\\nBulgogi Dupbop - It came with an abundance of beef, glass noodles, mushrooms and peppers. My favorite was the dough balls which were chewy and soaked up the broth. The broth was more on the sweet side. The portion was good for two people.\\n\\nSomaek - This is a Korean drink with beer and soju. I only tasted the beer.\\n\\nThe waitress thought I said tteokbokki soup instead of bulgogi. At first, we didn't realize the mistake so we tried the tteokbokki and it was so flavorful and spicy. The waitress was very friendly and replaced the teokbokki with the bulgogi.

We went right when they opened and wow, we were lucky because we're the last ones let in before they started letting others. They also take reservations so you can also book in advance.\\n\\nWe started with the chicken and veggie gyoza which was pretty delicious. One thing though I noticed after eating there and looking at their menu, they have a happy hour special for 1+1 which we should have gotten with the gyoza, but our waiter didn't tell us about it.  \\n\\nAdditionally, we had the sweet and spicy chicken (cheese buldak). Food was good, but I think they could have given more quantity for this dish for the price. \\n\\nThe kimchi sauce okonomiyaki was interesting - it was a true fushion dish of kind of like Jeon, but didn't have the thickness of Jeon. I think one thing they could do to improve this dish is cut it into pieces so that it is easier for those dining to eat and share with each other. \\n\\nThe blue crab fish cake hotpot was absolutely worth it and delicious!

It's got a very cute, hip but cozy ambiance, and service is fast and efficient.  We got several dishes to share:  Kimchi Okonomiyaki, Cucumber salad, Popcorn Chicken, Creamy Tteokbokki, Gochujang pork belly.  Everything was amazing, it was a perfect amount for four people.

We arrived in time for happy hour  for their buy 2 get 1 specials. The grilled mayo mackerel was a tasty starter, it\\'s a small but entire fish so you\\'ll need a little chopsticks magic to share, the truffle fries were on point for texture--crisp on the outside though frankly I didn\\'t taste much truffle in the two orders we got, though the white (ranch?) sauce was creamy and paired well. The popcorn tofu was a surprise, slightly less crisp of an exterior compared to the popcorn chicken but similar outer shell, kinda that sweet/sour/salty korean fried chicken kinda glaze, with tender tofu chunks inside. The popcorn chicken was also indulgent in a similar manner, served with small pieces of rice cake in the same sauce--def not health food though pretty yum! The budae Jungol was a standout, and at $32.99 was a good value. This came with dumplings, fish cake, ramen, egg, rice cake, pieces of hotdog and green veggies. Served over a flame this bubbling concoction was terrific to share amongst our group. My friends got a few drinks and enjoyed. \\n\\nThis place doesn\\'t really stand out in terms of decor except to give a dim, trendy vibe, and as another reviewer mentioned there are some \"shady stairs\" leading up to this restaurant--they are certainly narrow and old, and not the cleanest carpet I\\'ve seen, though that\\'s more on the building maintenance than this particular restaurant.

I really like the bulgogi stew because the beef was super flavorful and soft. It was a good dish. The army stew was pretty good, just your standard stew.

I tried a combo dish with 2 different proteins (beep and fried pork (Katu) on the rice and another dish with shrimp tempura on the rice. They are delicious and perfect portions.

I love dishes that invite us to do this. \\n\\nI went for the chopped heritage pork with sweet potato, black honey garlic butter, and collards - it did not disappoint: layers of flavors from the BBQ sauce to the slight mustard nuance, with the sweetness of the honey. It wasn't overpowering, just the right amount of flavorful interest. Chef Cupps served the dish herself, along with some charred cabbage which accompanied the BBQ perfectly. (As a Filipino American, I'm so proud of her accomplishments!)\\n\\nFinished with a black forest cake with chocolate pudding, sesame brittle and cherry jam...Wow! Cake was super moist, the tart cherry complimented the chocolate perfectly and the brittle added the perfect textual interest. \\n\\nLastly, the price point is spot-on!  With this clean and modern interior, fresh ingredients, and service...the price point is just fantastic.\\n\\nI'll definitely be back!\", \"My sister's pick. \\nGiving them 4 stars despite the hiccup at the end.\\n\\nCame to support the Filipina chef. \\nHow can you go wrong with a place named after an abuela?\\n\\nWe were a wee bit early for our reservation, but we got seated right away. Found parking right outside so a win right away. \\n\\nAs their setup is family style we went to town and got a few things to share. \\n\\nStarted off with the naan, beets and dip. We cleared those plates so quickly I don't remember exhaling. Next up was the pimiento toast. I wanted more, but more food was coming. \\nNext up was the crispy chicken thighs, noodz and chopped pork. I could've finished that chicken on my own. \\n\\nWe were nearing the end of our meal when my nephew looked at me and my sister with a concerned look. Turns out there was a tiny piece of hair on his plate, sitting right on top of the pasta. It was too short to be his and he has curly hair so it couldn't be his. I could barely see it, but my sister took a photo and concluded it was most likely an eyelash. We called our server who was way too nonchalant about it then took the plate to the kitchen. I stopped eating altogether. We still had a good amount of the noods left and a few bites of the pork. The floor manager came over quickly and fixed the whole ordeal. He took the noodles off our check and comped us a couple desserts. \\nHere's the kicker - I asked him if I could have a sample of their spicy vinegar sauce and this man gave me a whole ass bottle of it. \\nA big thank you to Nick for turning our frowns upside down. It's because of your generosity and chill vibes that I'm not giving this place a 1 star review. \\n\\nI'm taking that vinegar sauce back to LA.\", \"Stunning food!\\n\\nWe walked in for 2 and sat at the bar. It's a chef's counter and you can see quite a bit.\\n\\nWe ordered cocktails, the bread and dip, a salad, the farmer's market special, and the chicken. Our server recommended the chicken, and I'd definitely try it if it's your first time! Everything tasted wonderful, and I had some nice acidic and spicy bites. The bread and dip and the salad were all beautiful.\\n\\nCan't wait to try the rest of the menu.\\n\\nFriendly, quick service. Really cool vibe inside, the design was awesome. Nice bathrooms.\", 'So tasty! Have heard great things about the restaurant and finally got to try it. I think reservations are recommended; there is space for walkins but not much.\\n\\nEvery dish we ordered really hit the spot. My favorite dish was definitely the chicken thigh, as many others have pointed out. We asked for recommendations, and our server was really helpful in describing pretty much everything on the menu so we can get exactly what we wanted.\\n\\nMy friend also tried the pandan cocktail, which tasted great. Honestly kudos to the bartender! We also had the cookie dessert with oolong milk, the milk was actually the better half!', \"***Reservations Recommended, Excellent Service, Shareable Plates***\\n\\nThe stand out dishes for me were the chicken, the tilefish and the drinks. I was a bit disappointed by the noodle dish; it wasn't hot enough and the other dishes weren't memorable. Our server was also our bartender since we sat at the bar; he gave great drink recommendations. Overall I enjoyed the meal!\", 'Made a reservation the second the NYT review dropped lmao. My boyfriend and I were big fans of Untitled (RIP) and were happy to see the chef reappear here! I tried:\\n\\n+ Pandan punch\\n+ Carolina old fashioned \\n+ Fried tilefish lettuce wraps\\n+ Crispy chicken thighs\\n+ Beef and barley tartare\\n+ Stir fry egg noodle\\n+ Chocolate and black sesame pudding cake\\n+ Warm buckwheat chocolate chip cookie\\n\\nThe lettuce wraps and cookie were my favorite bites, followed by the chicken and egg noodles. Cocktails were also great, with a slight edge to the old fashioned. The only letdown was the cake, which was way too sweet.\\n\\nDefinitely will return!', \"Creative and fresh food but frankly I didn't get any strong Filipino vibes which I was hoping to have even a little- the noodles were yummy but lacked umami and the tuna was good but tasted more like a pan Asian or Hawaiian dish\\n\\nLeche flan was solid but too thick for my taste\\n\\nWill still return though to try the other dishes. \\n\\nIt was also a bit loud because it is popular which is great but hard to have a catch up dinner with a friend\", 'Hector the bartender was super friendly! We were waiting for our table to be ready, we had originally made a reservation. His friendly demeanor and knowledge of the menu; we ended up deciding to stay and have our dinner on the bar top', \"Lola's is a solid meal in Flatiron with some fun and creative Southern-Filipino eats. Got to try a variety of different things here and while we weren't necessarily wowed by anything (except one of the drinks, read on), everything was good to great and we left very satisfied. Start to finish it's a pleasant experience, from the decor/ambiance to the service to the food and drinks. If you happen to want a good meal near Penn Station/Midtown West that doesn't feel like a Midtown restaurant (iykyk) this is a fabulous option.\\n\\nWe cam here at around 9pm on a Saturday night. The place was still plenty full, bright and bustling. Decor is similar to that of a lot of new restaurants these days, with tons of greenery and natural elements to give clean, modern, natural aesthetic. We sat near the back of the space near the open kitchen which I always appreciate. \\n\\nTo drink, I had two fantastic cocktails while my partner did not really like either of his drinks, a Ferrari highball and the watermelon vodka drink (I didn't either, for what its worth). Oh well, live and learn. The first one, the Leche de Tigre (mezcal, ceviche sauce), was hyped up in pretty much every review I read prior to coming here and for good reason. Truly unique, an very savory mezcal margarita with, yes, the amalgam of wonderful flavors that go into a ceviche sauce. I then had the Calamansi Vesper (vodka or gin, dalandan) with gin, a little confusing that one needs to choose given that a true vesper is made with both gin and vodka, but good nonetheless. A little sweeter/milder than your typical vesper, so keep that in mind if you're lookig for a stiff and streamlined drink. \\n\\nFood-wise, we got a good sampling of the menu, particularly in the veggie department. The reviews of Lola's so far are complete raves so I was surprised that I wasn't as blown away by the food as others, but this is solid four stars which is nothing to scoff at. Eats, below:\\n\\nParaiso House Salad w/ gem lettuces, buttermilk ranch, sun gold tomatoes, pretzels: A-\\nNot the prettiest thing to look at but we both loved this. Heavenly dressing with fresh lettuce, and the use of pretzels in place of croutons was a fun touch. So obvious as a twist yet so genius at the same time. \\n\\nWatermelon and Beet Salad w/ st. germain goat cheese, tamarind honey: A\\nSummer in a dish, as fresh as can be. The combo of melon and beets is tried and true (I've had it one more time since we ate here and it was equally excellent), and the addition of the sliced goat cheese was subtle and perfect.  \\n\\nFried Tilefish Lettuce Wraps w/ kohlrabi slaw, jalapeño tartar: A+\\nDefinitely our winner of the night. Any fish taco or lettuce wrap preparation is going to stick out to me on a menu, and this one happened to get a flurry of positive reviews on every site I checked before. Lightly fried, perfectly seasoned, just great execution of flavors here. \\n\\nRoasted Short Rib w/ charred eggplant, hoisin, jimmy nardello peppers: A-\\nAnother great combination of flavors here, but the short rib itself was somehow not outstanding. Again, not bad, but compared to the other components in the dish it almost took a backseat. I couldn't tell you why, but if I had to guess maybe it was a touch under-seasoned. Still no regrets, we enjoyed the dish as whole thoroughly. \\n\\nUnion Square Bento w/ chili crisp summer squash, miso cabbage, potato + corn hash: A\\nLoved getting to sample some more veggies here -- in hindsight we probably could've lost one of the salads to properly enjoy this as it was the last thing to come and we were getting full by this point. That said, all three components were delicious, particularly the cabbage.\", 'The food was incredibly flavorful, and the portion sizes were just right. The restaurant encourages a family-style dining experience rather than individual menu items per person, which was a unique touch. The service was excellent, and the drinks were expertly crafted.', \"Lola's is something new and fresh and a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed Lola's version of an old fashion which had alittle heat. It was an interesting twist. The side of potatoes were delicious with a crispy outside and tender inside. \\n\\nAlso, there are some interesting desserts.\\nI had the chocolate pudding with meringue.  The short rib was not as inspiring as the other dishes. Servers were friendly and service efficient. The Southern twist makes this new restaurant.\", \"The service and ambiance here are excellent.  Overall, the food is good.  I really liked the pecan pimento ball and the naan.   Stir fried noodles with curry was delicious.   The bento box was a bit confusing  as it just seemed like a random assortment of bowls and wasn't presented in a bento box nor fit together thematically.  Overall though it was a great experience.\", 'Chef Suzanne Cupps created an amazing space with phenomenal food! I love how she honors her Filipino grandmother (\"Lola\" is the Filipino word for grandmother).\\n\\nConvenient location, lovely space (I highly recommend the chef counter seating for a small party of 1 or 2), and wonderful staff. Our server was patient and friendly and enthusiastic.\\n\\nAmazing dinner... each bite has us talking about how we each want to come back and bring others. \\n\\nCounter seat reservation for 2. Great to watch the chef and others in action and also to see what everyone else ordered as each dish was prepared. The server was patient with us as we asked questions and had trouble deciding.  We thought we knew what we wanted and then would see someone else\\'s dish go out and want that!\\n\\nShe had wine,  I had the Carolina Old Fashioned. This was a rough decision for me because all the cocktails sound great.  Next time I want to try the calamansi cocktail.\\n\\nWe shared all the food (and wished there were more people so we could order more to sample and share!).\\n\\nWe kept watching naans be made and baked in the oven so we HAD to order the carrot masala yogurt + naan to start. \\n\\nThe portions were larger than expected and everything was a pleasant surprise. We praised each first bite of each dish!\\n\\nThe portions were larger than expected, we are glad we had room for dessert after seeing the Filipino-style flan (lecheflan) being sliced and prepared.\\n\\nUnion Square Bento\\nCrispy Chicken Thighs (the spiced vinegar on the side was a nice touch!)\\nFish of the Week (seared tuna)\\n\\nAnd of course the Leche Flan for dessert.', \"New restaurant from the very talented Suzanne Cupps, with lots of amazing and unique dishes.\\n\\nMust start with the Crab Stuffed Littleneck Clams ($18) and the Paraiso House Salad ($19). The Fried Tilefish Lettuce Wraps ($22) are also incredible, as are the Heritage Country Rib Skewers ($31).\\n\\nFor dessert, don't miss the Warm Buckwheat Chocolate Cookie ($9), and a great Leche Flan ($12).\", \"Modern restaurant with an eclectic menu. Seemed liked there were influences from all over the world including South Asia, Japan, the south, and the Philippines. We came on a Wednesday around six and were seated immediately. The restaurant seemed almost entirely full by the time we left around 7:30.\\n\\nFull bar with a few beers poured from cans. Seemed like beverages were more focused on wine. I didn't look through the wine list throughly. \\n\\nWe started with the fried tilefish in lettuce wraps. A more urban or Californian take on fried fish tacos. The order includes two wraps and this was probably our favorite item of the evening. It's more citrusy and more acidic than the other items. Certainly a refreshing item. Eat them quickly before the freshly fried fish swelters the lettuce!\\n\\nFor the main course, we shared the curry noodles and the short rib. Noodles had a Japanese style curry sauce and topped with sautéed bok choy. Sauce felt on the sweeter side to me. I think there were hints of spiciness from pepper flakes too. Noodles were thick and long egg noodles. They were super slippery making them ideal for slurping!\\n\\nShort rib was roasted, but served sliced like a steak. An interesting presentation for this cut of meat. I was expecting a saucey dish in a bowl, but thought the steakhouse like platting made for an interesting surprise. It was topped with chimichurri like herb & oil sauce. Dish was served with roasted eggplant and peppers with what I believe was a balsamic reduction. Eggplant was one of my wife's favorite bites of the meal.\\n\\nThey had several appealing desserts but we were too full to indulge. Service was attentive and the pacing of the food was on point. They had two gender neutral restrooms; I believe one was handicap accessible. They had nice soap in the restrooms.\", 'It was really nice experience.  \\n1. The server was very helpful and friendly. He knew about the menu and the tasting notes of food items.  That was a refreshing no experience. \\n2. Food was cooked to perfection. We ordered - Naan with the spread, marinated beets, chicken things and another salad. Everything was lovely. \\n3. Ambiance was casual and not loud. It was relaxed and felt like we could enjoy our food and talk.', \"I came here for dinner a few weeks ago and had a fantastic experience. Having enjoyed Dig back then, I was excited to try chef Suzanne Cupps' new venture. We sat at the counter and were able to see her and her crew in action. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share between two of us. They were all super flavorful, fresh, and different from each other. We ended our meal with the flan and chocolate cake, both were delicious! Service was friendly and attentive at all times. The space is modern and very nicely decorated. I'd definitely recommend checking it out!\", 'The beau and I walked in hoping for a table but it was an hour wait so we sat at the bar. What an amazing experience it turned out to be. The menu is well designed beckoning you to order everything. The bar staff is friendly and knowledgeable making some recommendations that were spot on. Every dish we had was better than the next with the noodles and chicken standing out. Each dish exploded with freshness and was packed with flavor. The flan is an exceptional dessert and I would go back just for that. One of the best meals we have had in a very long time.', \"Cassandra provided excellent service! Before my friend arrived we discussed the menu, particularly items that contained raw egg and/or raw meat/fish. She advised how dishes could be modified to avoid these things. She recommended 4-6 dishes for the 2 of us. We only ordered 3 dishes and couldn't even finish those, which meant no room for dessert :( We ordered the Union Square bento, crispy chicken thighs and stir fry egg noodles. The egg noodles were my least favorite. I wasn't too crazy about the curry sauce; it's a mild curry. I liked the bok choy and asparagus with it. All the veggies overall were so good! The bento came with a squash and green bean medley, cabbage on a pancake and crispy potatoes. I could've been happy with just this! The crispy chicken wasn't greasy or fatty. Pulled it apart and ate it! Overall a very nice dining experience.\", \"Nice space and service was very good.\\nWe started with carrot masala yogurt + Naan.  Would like alittle more carrots but overall flavor was good.  Naan was great.  Next we had the paraiso house salad which was gem lettuces, buttermilk ranch, pretzels.  Love the dressing and pretzels but alittle plain for me. \\nNext we tried crispy chicken thighs.  Nice, crunchy coating.  I preferred the coconut vinegar - just a dab over fermented hot honey.  I couldn't really taste the honey but I was fine with just the  coconut vinegar.  We also tried the rib skewers with baked beans.  Menu says there was carolina bbq sauce which I didn't notice but meat was tender, well seasoned and very flavorful. \\nFor dessert, we tried the chocolate pudding cake which tasted so fresh and was very good. \\nOverall, a very nice meal and I would come back.\", \"Really more of a 3.5\\n\\nThis place just didn't hit for me. For 2 people we ordered the naan, beet salad, fried fish lettuce wraps, short rib and the chocolate cake. Of these dishes the fish and the chocolate cake were favorites, but in the context of the NYC dining scene nothing left me that impressed.\\n\\nOur server was incredibly knowledgeable on the food (and wine!), and even poured us half glasses.\", \"The triumphant return of Chef Suzanne Cupps! I've missed her food so much. We ordered the whole menu. Everything was fantastic.\", \"I read about Lola's in the New York Times and it was on my list of restaurants to try.  I visited Lola's last Friday and it was truly an experience. Walking in, I received a warm welcome from Hector behind the bar.  I was immediately seated by Cassandra who was friendly and helpful.  The service that I received from Joe and Isaiah was world class.  I took the time to learn their names because, quite frankly, they were just that good.\\n\\nLet's talk about the food.  Baby, baby, baby.  I had the naan with a yogurt dip that was so good, that I ordered one to take home to the fam.  Should have ordered two.  I had the salad with pretzels, tuna tataki and finished with a warm buckwheat cookie dipped in warm oolong tea.  It was fabulous.  The tuna tataki was seared on the outside and rare on the inside.  It was perfect.  The tilefish wraps have a jalapeno tartar sauce and the fish was tender and flavorful.  The cabbage and squash in the Bento Box were perfectly prepared  and paired with an apple/daikon radish salad that was very, very good.  \\n\\nThe wine was great.  My host, Isaiah, was very knowledgeable about the wines and helped me make a selection that truly fit my tastes.  He also suggested a dessert wine that paired perfectly with the warm cookie.  Yum.\\n\\nThis was more than a meal, this was an experience.  It was so good that I am going to gift it to my boss for Christmas.  I will definitely be returning more than once so that I can work my way through the menu.  \\n\\nAs I was packing up to leave, the Chef, Suzanne, came out to thank me for coming in and she was gracious and charming.  Also, her staff speaks very highly of her saying that she has created a harmonious working environment that is quite different than other restaurants where they have worked.  The harmony of this place is reflected in the food and service.  \\n\\nThis is a rare gem.  Epic review for an epic experience.\", 'Wonderful new restaurant in an up-and-coming neighborhood.  We had several dishes, almost all of which were special.\\n\\nThe house made naan and the fried tile fish lettuce wraps were superb, as was the signature chicken thighs and salad.  The Carolina gold Rice bowl was very good, except that I found the underlying rice a bit insipid and bringing the dish down a notch, even though I understand that\\'s what a rice bowl is. The fluke was beautifully cured, the cucumber and the trout roe were excellent, although some of the trout roe perhaps was a bit thick \"shelled,\" giving it a slightly odd texture. But it was delicious.\\n\\nFor dessert the leche flan was very well executed and a distinct dish, though its authenticity is perhaps not for everyone. \\n\\nBoth of our wines were excellent, but my only quibble is that they\\'re pour felt insufficient and was the one feature that seemed marred.  Each glass of wine plus ordinary tip (of the four or five that I quickly skimmed) was more than the retail cost of the bottle.  Even in this inflationary time, the pour should have been more generous.\\n\\nPutting that last minor quibble aside, I found the restaurant dynamic, the food really good, the ambiance great, and the head chef was utterly charming.  The service was quite professional.  I\\'d give it a big thumbs up and a strong recommendation.', \"Lola's is a new restaurant mixing Filipino + American southern cooking and it's excellent. We recently went and sat at the open kitchen counter. The restaurant was crowded so reservations is a safe bet. \\n\\nThe plates are shareable, though the larger portions could easily be a single person entree. We had;\\n\\nBeef + Black Barley Tartare - this was very good, the addition of gochujang adds a nice kick. \\n\\nBLT Toast - excellent, the tomatoes were the star of this dish - fresh, flavorful and delicious.\\n\\nUnion Square Bento - this is broken up into 3 dishes - chili crisp summer squash, miso cabbage, potato & corn hash. This was one of our favorite dishes of the meal. The star of the 3 was the miso cabbage, like the tomatoes the cabbage was another perfectly executed piece of produce.\\n\\nSouthern Chopped Heritage Pork - favorite dish, this was excellent. The pork was flavorful and juicy. The peaches added a great sweetness to the savoriness. Highly recommend.\\n\\nStir Fried Egg Noodles - very good, we particularly enjoyed the curry. Another solid main dish to order.\\n\\nStone Fruit Cobbler - blue cornbread with a fruit puree, only complaint is wish there was more because it was so good. \\n\\nLike the food the service was excellent. Lola's is a great new restaurant to visit.\", \"Sensational Meal.  This chef is incredible.  We were a group of four that shared everything as our server suggested.  The tilefish was so good.  A fish we had never had but just wonderful.  So was the crispy chicken thigh and the slow roasted short rib.  You can't go wrong on anything here.    The cocktails are cool and original and the ambience also perfect.  You can actually hear each other in here although every table was filled!  Save room for the flan and the chocolate chip cookie which doesnt sound like a big deal was absolutely divine.    One of the best new spots in NYC!\", 'Awesome spot. The pimento cheese appetizer and the pork rib skewers are delicious. New twist on some southern classics.', \"Nice decor and service. The food is hit and miss. This place is more 3.5 stars but rounding up because it feels like the place has potential.\\n\\nAppetizers were creative and interesting twists on flavors familiar to Asian cuisine. The best is the naan. The lettuce wrap of tilefish was lacking a bit in presentation and flavor. Tilefish is already bland and flaky, to add a bit of flavor pop it would have been better to put more spice and pop to the batter and the acidic pickle elements.\\n\\nThen they dropped the ball, especially on the rice dish. The rice is Carolina gold. It's long grained starchy rice. It is prepared in a chirashi type way with raw elements on top. The problem is when rice like Carolina gold is prepared this way it becomes hard and starchy and difficult to chew. That rice is best prepared as fried rice or crispy rice. The single dish was so bad it took away from an otherwise excellent dinner.\\n\\nThe short ribs was also a bit dry with confusing elements that lacked a punch of flavor. It would have been better to just go with more Asian inspired southern BBQ or curry leaning marinade for the ribs and not an inbetween pulled meat and BBQ with chimchuri and sauce and this and that type flavors.\\n\\nAll in all I'll probably go back and give it another chance to see if they fixed some of the kinks.\", \"One of the best meals we've had in a long time! We sat at the counter where we could watch the food prep.  Amazing attention to detail. Service was impeccable. \\n\\nStuffed clams 10/10 if we didn't have so much more food coming, I would have gotten a second order\\nCarrot yogurt naan 9/10\\nFish in lettuce cups 10/10 \\nPork skewers and beans 9/10 the beans were my favorite part, not what I was expecting but delicious \\nFried chicken 11/10  I'm usually underwhelmed by fried chicken, but this was truly special.  \\n\\nWe found it to be very reasonably priced for the quality and service.\", \"Got an early table for a Friday night dinner. Interior is stylish, cozy, and clean. Service was great and the staff was clearly in a groove. Food was solid - we loved the potatoes that came with the bento box, the fried chicken thighs, the carrot masala yogurt app, and the pecan pimento cheese ball. The other aspects of the bento box (the broccoli and the cabbage pancake) were just ok and came out a little soggy. Overall, a great first dining experience - I'd be happy to go back.\", \"Delicious food and good service! We didn't have any reservation placed so we waiting for about 20 minutes before a seat at the bar opened up. We loved the chicken and Thai noodles !\\n\\nBeautiful green tiling as well!\\nDelicious flan and chocolate cake, both surprisingly gluten free!\", \"I have been a fan of Suzanne Cupps' food for quite a while, first at Untitled and then at the wonderful, albeit short lived 232 Bleecker. Well, Lola's has just been open for about six weeks and it already feels like it's been there for years. The design is casual but really chic with a terrific energy about it. The staff could not be nicer and more professional, particularly Nick, Asha, Hector and Luke. \\nAnd the food!!! I'm a fried chicken guy and a huge Blue Ribbon lover. Well Blue Ribbon's chicken is now #2 after Lola's Crispy Chicken Thighs! So crispy yet so moist. The Crab Stuffed Little Neck Clams, Paraiso House Salad and Heritage Country Rib Skewers are all delicious. And the Chocolate+Black Sesame Pudding Cake is the best damn dessert I've had in ages.

We sat near the back of the space near the open kitchen which I always appreciate.', 'Great service - the host, who was also the general manager, was friendly and accommodating, and our outgoing server with blue hair was fun and knowledgeable. The food was delightful. Each dish was thoughtful and delicious with an Asian flair. The space is beautiful, quite large, and minimalist, which brings me to my main critique: the acoustics. Yikes. Who designed a NYC restaurant in this day and age without taking acoustics into account? Not one sound panel was installed to dampen the inevitable dull roar stemming from stark walls, concrete floors, and tin ceilings. I appreciate the beauty of minimalist decor, but yelling through dinner is a bummer. Most everything else was on point.', 'Wow. Hat\\'s off to Chef Suzy. Her menu is eclectic and brilliant.\\n\\nThe service: Phenomenal (Adam)\\n\\nAmbience: \\nMy wife and I sat at the chef\\'s bar and it was a delight.

The clam is chopped up with the crab, instead of under the crab (which is what I thought it would be).\\n\\nYogurt and Masala Carrots and naan 9.5/10. The only reason this is not a 10 is bc I had left over bread but the yogurt was gone. \\n\\nChicken Thighs 11/10 (this was a surprise). I\\'ve had a lot of \"our fried chicken is the best...\" but this actually was some of the best I\\'ve had.\\n\\nPork Skewers and baked beans 9/10: This tasted very German (sweet and sour vinegar, dill, mustard, red cabbage and buttery) but Germans had a big influence on South Carolina -- particularly Charleston, so that makes sense.\\n\\nHighlight of the Night:\\nChef Suzy is a real one. She has set the tone for the entire restaurant. I loved watching her interact and encourage her chefs. She was also so accessible. In some ways she reminds me of a young Susan Feniger.', \"Disclaimer:  I have not had the good fortune of eating at this restaurant, yet, but will soon.  As someone with celiac, the NY Times review that I just read brought tears to my eyes.   Thank you, Chef Cupps, for taking care of those who love crispy things but often can't order them in restaurants, because they're usually coated in wheat flour.   That you tool the step to use alternative flours for your fish shows an amazing awareness and sensitivity that I wish all chefs had.    Thank you so much.  I hope other chefs learn from you.\", \"Lola's was phenomenal! The food was fantastic and the service was perfect. The story behind the name of the restaurant is so sweet, and the Chef was perfect.

We sat at the kitchen bar area, and our server was wonderful. Friendly and knowledgeable and attentive. We tried a variety of the small  and large plates with about half standing out and the rest just okay. What really was a bummer, though, were the station chefs all working in front of the bar where we were seated. All were glum and low energy and just seemed miserable. Didn't see a smile in ninety minutes. I have no expectations around the moods of restaurant staff, but don't create a specific seating area overlooking a team that clearly wants to be anywhere else on earth.\", \"Love this new spot!

Great ambiance.  Highly recommend.  Visiting from SF. We have high standards.  Will be back !', \"A fabulous dinner here last night - sitting at the bar by the kitchen and seeing close up the team at work.  To pick a highlight would be difficult but perhaps the Bento box with its fabulous cabbage, beans in a really fresh sauce. Don't miss out on the naan bread, perhaps the best I have had, with the carrot masala yoghurt.  Service is excellent - and we were lucky enough to chat with Susannah, the chef patron. her philosophy of clean simplicity with the best local and fresh ingredients really shows through in the food.  Highly recommended.\", \"Really awesome food and service. Small and large plates that are easy to share. Food is a mix of American Filipino and Southern with a hint of Korean (don't miss the fried chicken and pickled vegetables or the vegetarian bento box with awesome fried potatoes.) Many other dishes are standouts too - beet salad, fried fish in lettuce tacos, clams, beef tartare, and scallops. Plenty of options for carnivores, vegetarians and pescatarians.

Honestly really yummy, but can\\'t hold a candle to the insane apps.\\n\\nService is really good, very attentive despite the busyness which is to be expected for a Michelin place.', 'Tried Jeju Noodle bar for lunch. The service here is very good and their appetizers in particular are really good. We ordered three things:\\n- Toro Ssam Bap: 11/10, if you order nothing else get this! Was pricey but it did have caviar on top. I think it would have tasted just as good without caviar because the toro was really carrying the dish. It reminded me of one of the dishes they made on culinary class wars.\\n- Family Ramyun: it was good but does not live on in my memory. Pretty mild, salty and milky broth. The shrimp was nicely cooked.\\n- Gochu Ramyun: not my favorite, very smokey but my boyfriend liked it\\n\\nI agree with the overall assessment that the starters here was what shine over the noodles. If I came back I would probably order only appetizers and the toro ssam bap again.', \"Jeju Noodle Bar was a solid dining experience, but I found it to be slightly underwhelming give its reputation. I had a bit higher expectation for this as this was my first Michelin star experience. I thought their appetizers were fantastic, and they were honestly better than the main courses. \\n\\nToro Ssam Bap: 5/5 this was my favorite dish of the night! The toro was buttery smooth and fresh. The combination of flavors of the rice and condiments paired perfectly. \\n\\nTruffle Scallops: 4/5 I'm a huge scallop lover so this was another favorite dish of mine. The earthiness of the truffle elevated the natural sweetness of the scallops and had a hint of yuzu. \\n\\nJeju Fried Chicken: 2/5 The chicken was so crispy and flavorful. However, I do think this dish is overpriced/overhyped for what it is. The fried chicken itself was nothing special, it was the dip and caviar that makes it seem slightly more elevated although I don't think those two items were necessary or added much to the overall flavor of the dish. The dish was $31 and comes with 2 pieces, and they charged $5 per extra piece of chicken! Not worth the money.\\n\\nWagyu Ramyun: 4/5 The broth was rich, and wagyu was so tender. However, I again don't think it's worth the price and I would not pay $45 for this bowl of ramen again. \\n\\nGochu Ramyun: 3/5 This was just okay in my opinion. It had a strong kimchi flavor but wasn't very memorable.\\n\\nLobster Myun 3/5 This was a pretty solid dish, the flavor was strong, and it was nice and creamy. There was also a decent amount of lobster chunks. \\n\\nOverall, the service was attentive, and ambiance was cozy. The food was tasty, but I felt some dishes were pretty overpriced and it didn't quite live up to the Michelin hype for me. Still, it's worth trying if you're in the area and curious!\", \"Finally got a reservation at Jeju noodle bar and me and my friend went for dinner. \\n\\nThe place is small and intimate which explains the difficulty getting a reservation here but this place gets packed! \\n\\nMy friend and I started off with the toro ssam and it was perfection. Probably one of my favorite dishes I've had in the city, I understand why people come here for this dish. Soft toro, and flavors of sesame, the dish is so good. \\n\\nThe scallop is also really good with the truffle! If you like yuzu it's a must order as well. \\n\\nI've never had a vegetarian mushroom ramen that was so rich in my life. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the broth was so rich and delicious, I would definitely order it again.\", 'This has been on my list for like 3 years and finally got a reservation when I randomly checked one night. I had high expectations but it was a bit of a mixed bag. The Toro Ssam Bap was absolutely delicious, if everything we ordered impressed me like this did, I would give 5 stars. The texture was great and the flavors were diverse and well balanced. We got the Gochu Ramen and it was just way way way too salty. I felt like I had to drink a bunch of water to balance it out. We also ordered the Lamb Ja Jang Myun -- this was pretty good, a lot of the vegetables added more flavor to a typical Chinese black bean noodle. \\nOverall mixed bag but still delicious. Staff was helpful and nice and ambiance would be perfect for a date.', \"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner, because it's been on her radar for a little while. Things got off to a bit of a bad start because it took quite a while for anyone to come by and take our order. That being said, the staff were quite friendly and apologetic so it was no big deal and we were excited for the food.\\n\\nWe ordered two appetizers, the fried chicken and caviar, and finally the pepper ramyun. Overall I think the food was fine, but I would honestly and sadly say this is the most underwhelming Michelin level restaurant I've tried so far. The small apps were good, I really liked the fish and caviar. The fried chicken dish was terrible, however. Not only was the chicken mostly flavorless besides oil, the combination with the caviar makes no sense. If you eat it together you only get oily taste and crunchy texture, so you would be wasting the caviar. Our hands were an oily mess after too- and this is coming from someone who always eats with his hands lol. The noodles were nice and I liked the broth, but it was a bit lacking in flavor besides just pepper, and again the noodles were fine but I've had better at many lesser regarded places.\\n\\nI think overall for the price, I'd sadly say this place is probably a skip. It's not bad by any means, but it is highly overrated. Perhaps I just came on a really off day, but I won't be going back to try again.\", \"Do not recommend. I am so sad. This restaurant was on my list for so long and it absolutely crushed at how much it left to desire. \\n\\nTo start, for a Michelin star restaurant the service was not good. We only saw a waiter once when we ordered and busters bring our food. Never refilled our water, never asked us how things were (because if they asked I'd be honest about the cold ramen). I understand this is a casual restaurant but I've had better service at chain restaurants. \\n\\nWe were also seated at the counter which we usually love but at this place all you're looking at behind the counter is the employee's belongings and piles of random stuff. \\n\\nNow for the food: \\n\\nToro Ssam Bap - it was good, not as epic as I wanted it to be. \\nFried chicken with caviar - same as above, good fried chicken, nothing special.\\n\\nWagyu Ramyun - this I had the highest expectations for as it's a Michelin star noodle bar, this was the one I was saddest about. The broth was not very flavorful and it was actually COLD. I had a bite and gave the rest to my partner. I wanted to tell someone it was cold but I couldn't even get a server's attention. \\n\\nI could've cried at how sad I was after eating here, I had such high hopes and was waiting to go here forever and it just dropped the ball.\", '十二分饱！I ate way too much. The appetizers were super delicious. I had the Toro Ssam Bap and the Ja Jang Style Ribs. The former felt like a build your own caviar kim from Jua, and it was so so good. 100% order this when you come.\\n\\nThe Ja Jang Style Ribs was quite large, and was coated in a sweet marinade. Also very good.\\n\\nThe ramyun was pretty mediocre though. We got the wagyu ramyun and family style ramyun. Both were nothing special. And considering that the restaurant is a self-proclaimed noodle bar, this was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nIf I had to do it again, I would have cut the wagyu ramyun and gotten another appetizer.\\n\\nI was considering giving this a 3 star, but the toro ssam bap was too good. Low 4/5', \"Their Toro Ssam Bap is a decadent appetizer that is great for sharing . This dish is worth ordering next time . I love ssam-style eating and having this dish with seaweed was just right.  Their Lobster Myun had great elements in terms of flavor, noodle texture, and lobster meat - the issue was that it was too salty. \\n\\nThe service wasn't the best . The server took quite a bit longer than expected to come take our order and also didn't show us the dessert menu.\", \"I don't know why this place is hard to rsvp or has a Michelin star it was very average and unremarkable. And I love modern Korean food but man Jeju missed the mark by miles.\\n\\nThe service was bad... they did not read the reservation notes at all and forgot 3 items in our very simple order. What's worse they didn't tell us they did not have the uni until after we received the toro ssam bap. Which is unacceptable being that we were the first sitting and it's their star dish! Then forgot the poach eggs for both our ramen orders until we mentioned it. Cherry on top was we mentioned celebrating a birthday on the notes and nothing not even a note or hostess saying happy birthday... zero acknowledgement which soured the mood. \\n\\nWe had the toro ssam bap, which was good but they didn't tell us they didn't have uni until after we had order it and VERY overpriced. The fluke hwe which was refreshing. Ja jang style ribs were good, and thankfully got them otherwise you'll be hungry after the ramen lol. Gochu and family ramyun were average which was disappointing because they supposedly a noodle bar after all.\\n\\nThe ambience felt like a modern American restaurant honestly. I didn't understand why they had a massive bar if it wasn't really utilized for anything at least on top of it. We forgot that we were even in a Korean restaurant because it didn't feel like it at all. \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend them just because it's too pricy for something so average and bad service.\", \"Best soy egg I've ever eaten. Please add that on if you are getting a soupy noodle dish, you won't regret it.\\n\\nWagyu Ramyun is rich and flavorful, yet the broth isn't too heavy and it's quite refreshing. Very innovative dish. \\n\\nHefty price tag, good to try once but the pull to come back isn't there.\", \"Highly recommend the Toro Ssam Bap and truffle scallop!! 10/10!! The seafood is so fresh and flavors are so balanced. The service is great and staff are friendly. The interior of the restaurants feels cozy. We skipped the ramen cause we heard that it's very salty but the appetizers area great. Definitely make a reservation to check out this spot. \\n\\nValue: 8.5/10\\nFood:9.5/10\\nService :8/10\", \"We had the Ja Jang Style Ribs and Family Ramyun. Both were delicious and good value especially for a Michelin star restaurant  and NYC standards where sadly everything is overpriced these days! One of the best service in the city, shout out to Chang Woo and the entire staffs who were both professional and friendly. Wished it wasn't so hard to get a reservation though ;)\", \"I was pretty excited to try this place after hearing a lot of good things, but honestly was pretty underwhelmed. \\n\\nWe tried the famous toro ssam bap, as well as the lobster and wagyu ramyuns. The ssam bap was solid but nothing crazy, and not worth the price tag imo. I thought both noodles were too salty, and the wagyu ramyun didn't have a lot of flavor and was quite heavy. I did enjoy the flavor of the lobster though!\\n\\nOverall, I don't really understand why everyone is fighting so hard to eat here.\", \"I was finally able to snag a reservation for Jeju Noodle Bar, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is very intimate and romantic. The service is super nice and kind, offering to answer any questions we had. We got the toro ssam bap and added uni, and you guys I feel like it changed my life because it was so good. I am giving five stars mainly because this dish was amazing. We also go the ribs that were tender and flavored so well. It smelled so good once they set it on the table. I saw reviews that their ramyun was mediocre, but since it's called Jeju noodle bar we had to get a noodle right?We got the gochu ramyun and sadly, it was only okay. I would probably skip the ramyun if I came again. I definitely want to try other things on the menu next time! You just cannot miss the toro ssam bap if you come!\", \"We shared one appetizer and two noodle dishes between three of us and all felt pretty full. I felt that both the toro ssam bap and lamb ja jang myun were good but didnt blow me away. The lamb is ja jang myun flavor is definitely more Chinese than Korean tasting. It was also quite earthy/gamey. The standout dish for me was the lobster myun. There were some chunks of lobster at the bottom but the emulsion had a very strong lobster taste that I enjoyed. Would come back to try their other dishes like the wagyu since they're known for it!\", \"Came here for dinner with a couple friends on a Thursday and the restaurant was quite full! Luckily, we made a reservation ahead of time and were seated pretty quickly. We sat at one of the high tables in the middle of the restaurant and the lighting was on the darker side with a nice table lamp. The staff gave us great recommendations for food, and we had a great experience overall. \\n\\nMy favourite dish was definitely the Toro Ssam Bap - the fish was so fresh and there was so much caviar on top! Delicious scoop with the rice and seaweed. The Donkatsu was really big - we shared with 3 people and still couldn't finish it. The sauce was really delicious but the pork wasn't as crispy as I imagined. The Jeju Fried Chikin, however, was sooo crispy and juicy! The Ja Jang Myun and Ramyun were slightly on the saltier side for my personal preference, but had great textures. We were surprised they didn't have any cocktail menu, but they had some nice wines at the restaurant. \\n\\nWould recommend visiting if you get a chance!\", \"I haven't been back to JeJu Noodle Bar in a hot minute so when one of my girlfriends suggested it for dinner, I said all in. I have to say, JeJu Noodle Bar did not disappoint. The Toro Ssam Bap was worth the share - a medley of textures in your mouth & every bite is an explosion of heaven just waiting to happen. Also, the Gochu Ramyun was solid - bold flavor perfect for an autumn-like evening. Delish!\\n\\nMake sure to make reservations for sure!!!\", \"The ambiance is very nice, and the staff were very attentive. It's perfect for a date spot or a small gathering with 2-3 friends. My absolute favorite was the toro ssam bap. I would go back again just to have that dish. We also tried the ceviche, gochu ramyun and lamb jajangmyun. They all tasted good, but nothing spectacular. I would probably try other things on the menu next time.\", 'I\\'ve visited Korea more than once and primarily stayed in large cities on the peninsula such as Seoul and Pusan, and I didn\\'t know that raw fish or raw beef was also used in Korean cuisine. Evidently, raw fish is featured in the cuisine of Jeju Island. Quite a few of the dishes at Jeju Noodle Bar have heavily flavored raw fish that is different from the raw fish commonly served in Japanese restaurants. Our group of four ordered three appetizers and two noodle dishes. \\n\\nThe three appetizers were Toro Ssam Bap (fatty tuna), Clam & Seabream, and Ja Jang Style Ribs. The first two both featured raw seafood mixed with such flavorings as shallots, serrano pepper and olive oil. Toro Ssam Bap is the closest to Japanese sushi, but it\\'s the diner rather than the chef who rolls the raw fish and rice in toasted seaweed. The Clam & Seabream is cured in a heavily flavored liquid. The seafood in both of these dishes was of high quality and would almost melt in your mouth. Ja Jang Style Ribs had a lot of pork on them and were very tender and flavorful.\\n\\nThe noodle dishes we had were Wagyu Ramyun and Lobster Myun. Ramyun is the Korean spelling of ramen, presumably based on the Chinese word \"lamian\" (noodles made from stretching a piece of soft dough), and Myun simply means noodle, presumably derived from the Chinese word \"mian\". The beef in the Wagyu Ramyun was raw but would become partly cooked when it is mixed into the hot soup and noodles. The flavor is relatively light, differing from the typical Korean noodle dishes that are strongly flavored and spicy. Perhaps this is why some customers were a little disappointed and found the noodles to lack in flavor. The noodles in Lobster Myun were thick and al dente, and the soup was again fairly light but flavorful. \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed every one of the dishes, although none of us in the group were awed by the food. Perhaps we had unrealistic expectations given how hard it is to get a reservation at this restaurant.', 'Getting a reservation was not easy or quick, but it was more than worth the effort and wait!\\n\\nLiterally 5 stars across the board.\\nService\\nAmbiance\\nComfort\\nMenu\\nAnd of course the food!\\n\\nThis is a nice cozy little noodle bar in the West Village. Cozy being the nice way of saying small. The size of the restaurant definitely contributes to making it so difficult to secure a reservation. That being said the cozy nature helped to set the tone for the evening. Not once did it ever get too loud. Small amount of people in the restaurant. \\n\\nIt helped to make a more relaxed comfortable environment, one where you could get away from the City and almost have a private moment with whoever you are with.\\n\\nIf you are trying your to make a reservation they only do that for 2 persons minimum. If you are a solo diner you show up. Put your name down and if they can accommodate you they will. No guarantees but I would wait for this food.\\n\\nThe Wagyu Ramyun was so comforting and light, noodles were chewy, Wagyu was tops. Soup was outstanding, especially the portion that had all the umami goodness from the Wagyu.\\n\\nThe lobster Myun enveloped you in an embrace. Much heavier, and had hints of Italian flavor in the dish. \\n\\nThe Toro Ssam Bap. I could literally eat it forever.\\n\\nGonna have to come back again. Maybe with someone or I will happily wait for a table for one.', \"This place was on my bucket list. It's the first noodle place that has a Michelin star. \\n\\nThe service is fast and the staff are knowledgeable so ask questions about the menu if you have them. \\nWe started with the toro ssam bap which is highly recommended. It's pricy but it's light, refreshing, and a lovely way to start the meal. I got the family ramyun which was amazing. The shrimp was flavorful, the broth was aromatic, and the whole thing came together. My husband got the wagyu ramyun and he loved it. The wagyu was tender and melted in the mouth. \\n\\nMake a reservation if you want to eat there because if you choose to walk-in you might be waiting a while.\", \"PROS: The toro ssam bap was creamy with little surprises of pickled radish - if it wasn't so pricey I could eat this every day. Also they have 5 Michelin stars wow\\n\\nCONS: Service was almost nonexistent and the noodles were underwhelming. Expensive and difficult to get a reservation.\", \"As one knows, it's hard to get a reservation here. My partner and I were able to snag a bar-seat reservation at 5:30pm on a Saturday.\\n\\nAmbiance\\nAmbiance in terms of decor and lighting are nice, elevated, and what I'd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. Especially since my partner and I were here for a special occasion, we were excited to be at Jeju noodle bar to celebrate our anniversary (they don't do anything special for special occasions here though).\\n\\nMy few observations with the bar-seating: \\n- The staff often came back to this bar area after they took orders or brought back water pitchers/poured the wine. Because I was the seat at the end of the counter, one guy was standing directly across from me almost the entire night. And our server was posted directly across from my side the entire night as well. I didn't feel like I had much privacy (I do understand that was probably both of their spot out of convenience, and to oversee the rest of the restaurant, but I won't lie that I was slightly uncomfortable to be seated right across from both of their watchful gazes, which may speak more to the lack of space in the restaurant and not their fault at all.)\\n\\n- I'm short in height, and the ramen bowls are rather big/high (not complaining about that!), but because of that, the bowl and I were at an awkward height. I don't have a picture of it but trust me it felt awkward eating for me, where I felt like I was lowering the spoon to my mouth than the other way around.\\nI understand reservations are (very) hard to get here, but dang I was jealous of this guy solo-eating his ramen at two-person high top table while we had the bar seating, in the situation detailed-above. (Tell me how to reserve that table next time!!)\\n\\nFood\\n- Toro Ssam Bap - This dish really was delicious and fun to eat. I don't think I've ever had caviar until this meal, and it was good! The Toro was the best part though for sure. Worth the price to me!\\n- Family Ramyun - My favorite part of this dish was the shrimp, which had a perfect texture. The calabrian chili gives it a nice kick. It was a good ramen overall\\n- Gochu Ramyun - I thought the broth had an interesting flavor. The pork belly was super soft.\\n\\nThe ramens are decent, especially for the price points ($23). The broths were so rich and high quality, so I enjoyed them, but to me it is hard to differentiate ramens between places, and I wasn't blown away from the ramens we ordered at least (thinking about Ippudo which offer ramens $20-$26).\\n\\nService\\nOur server did his job well overall, but I was surprised for a Michelin-starred restaurant, he was definitely not excited to be there. It was also confusing because we were given a water pitcher so I refilled my waters the entire night except for two times, when our server came by and refilled it, but there were times he was standing by the counter, and didn't refill it when it was empty. I don't mind, but also it seemed inconsistent.\\n\\nI want to rate 3.5/5 but I'll round up. Food was yum, vibes were okay, but I was not wow'ed overall.\", \"I absolutely love this place. their uni over thir noodles blew me away it's a must order everytime i come here.  i don't know what else is there accept get the uni over noodles soup.  i can eat that everyday it's so good.\", 'Food was ok. Not sure why it is called JEJU noodle because nothing was particularly \"jeju\". What was memorable was the bathroom. They have one all-gender bathroom. I was there for dinner, and it was dirty. The le labo hand soap felt juxtaposed by the trash can overflowing with paper towels and sticky floors. I guess the michelin guide doesn\\'t care about bathroom hygiene, but I do. I won\\'t go back.', \"TLDR: Though next to impossible to get a reservation, I will certainly be trying to dine here again as the service was perfect and the food absolutely knocked it out of the park. \\n\\nSETTING: Somehow by some miracle, a friend got a res here at 6:45pm for 4 on a Saturday night. The ambiance was not what I was expecting - it's dimly lit, the restaurant is essentially a large room with a chandelier. It is very moody/cool - buzzy but not too loud, and perfect for any occasion.\\n\\nFOOD: We ordered so much food I think our server thought something was wrong with us. I like to think he was impressed at our eating ability because we finished every. Single. Plate with not one morsel of food left behind.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n- amberjack and onion (incredibly fresh and delicious with the onion that cuts through the fish)\\n- truffle scallop (holy hell mouth watering)\\n- gochujang bokum (perfect no notes)\\n- jajjang ribs (I was most uncertain about ordering this one but damn were the ribs excellent)\\n- lobster myun (so perfect my mouth is salivating just looking at the picture)\\n- family ramyun (I don't really love ramyun I know it's blasphemy but this one I'll eat every time)\\n- fried chicken (with caviar!! what else could you want)\\n- TWO toro ssam baps (and yes two were absolutely necessary)\\n- chocolate ice cream with truffle for dessert (such a creamy chocolate ice cream and they don't skimp on the truffle)\\n\\nI would order all of the above again with no question if I got another res. If *gun to head* I had to choose one dish to eat for the rest of my life, it would be between to toro ssam (because what's better than toro, uni and caviar??) or the lobster myun (I just loved the flavors).\\n\\nSERVICE. I wish I could remember our servers name to give him a shout because he was great. Though the restaurant was busy, and we ordered (and ate) like feral animals, he took it all in stride and was available, checking in, and very nice and gracious.  As a reward for our gluttonous behavior he even gave us ice cream on the house. As if we needed more food!! But I'll never forget this gesture!\\n\\nVERDICT: If I could I would go back every single weekend. I want to bring my family, my friends, anyone I know, here so they can try some of this insane elevated Korean food. This is a must visit restaurant!!!\", \"Shocking (and not in a good way). My friends and I had been wanting to try jeju noodle bar ever since moving to NY but knew it was hard to get a reservation and pretty impossible to walk in. We ended up booking a reservation for Sunday at 3pm right when they open and even then all the tables were full and I overheard them telling a party that was trying to walk in that they were fully booked. They surprisingly are a pretty small restaurant with not a lot of tables (unless there was seating downstairs I didn't notice).\\n\\nMy friends and I were seated immediately - the interior is nice and it was dark so it felt like we were eating at a reasonable dinner time rather than 3pm lol. We decided to do family style and share everything so we ordered appetizers (toro ssam bapp, truffle scallop) and ramens (lamb jajangmyun, lobster myun, and gochu ramen). The toro ssam bapp we knew was super popular so we ordered although it was a staggering $55. The ramens the waiter had recommended/said were most popular were the lobster myun and gochu ramen. We debated ordering the wagyu ramen but had heard it was overhyped and decided against it.\\n\\nThe appetizers were the highlight of our meal. Loved both especially the toro ssam bapp. The portion of it however was definitely smaller than anticipated but still amazing flavors. The flavor of the scallops were great as well. By this time, my friends and I were impressed and talking about the next time we'd be back. But everything went quickly downhill when the noodles came out. After my table and I tried all 3 ramens, we simultaneously looked at each other with the same thoughts in our head that really not a single one of the ramens were particularly great.\\n\\nLamb jajangmyun - tastes much more in the style of the chinese version (zhajiangmian) which is a very different taste from the korean jajangmyun. This threw me off a lot considering this is a Korean restaurant (with the korean romanization on the menu). If I knew it was going to be more like the chinese version, I would not have ordered. Also something weird is that I've seen other reviews of this saying it was overly sweet which is more like the korean version but the one we had was not sweet at all, so I don't know if today was just a fluke or what.\\n\\nLobster myun - desperately missing salt (and maybe other seasonings too). As I was eating it, I was expecting some other flavor to hit but it just never did and fell flat. Lobster myun and lamb jajangmyun flavors both got so old so fast.\\n\\nGochu ramen - not BAD but your pretty average typical ramen from any ramen place in NYC. The broth was nice and for the price I SUPPOSE it was the most worth it out of the ramens but not something I'd ever go out of my way to come back for.\\n\\nSomething else I noticed was that when we came in, it was immediately packed but midway through our meal (4-5pm) most of the tables were open and for like at least 45 minutes that it made me wonder whether they purposely don't put all the tables on resy to make them appear more exclusive and difficult to get into. Maybe they have them open for walk ins (which I'm doubtful of) since even then I'd overheard hostesses telling people who were walking in that they are fully booked... so that's a mystery.\\n\\nService was great though, the waiters told us the best way to eat each dish and kept coming back to refill our waters even though we each had a water jug at our table.\\n\\nOverall, the fact that we tried THREE different ramens and NONE of them were particularly great for being a noodle bar was incredibly disappointing. Keeping this review at 3stars purely because the apps were good (but even then it's probably closer to a 2.5). This was not worth the price (came out to $240 total), the effort to make the reservation in the first place, and even going out of my way to eat a meal at 3pm. I half think that people give good ratings for this restaurant because they subconsciously know how popular it is and that they have a michelin star, while in their actual comments they will also say that the noodles are not even good. Would skip.\", \"This place has been on my list for a while and I finally got a reservation to go with some friends! The vibes are fun and food was good, but there's only two items I would recommend and ironically it isn't their noodle dishes. My personal favorites ate the fried chicken and the tuna tartare bibimbap! The noodle dishes and pork chops were okay but nothing special in my opinion for the price and was on the saltier side. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Jeju Noodle Bar and if I were to go back I would only the fried chicken and tuna bibimbap.\", \"Kind of disappointing experience. We ordered the Toro Ssambap, Mushroom Ramyun, and Wagyu Ramyun. \\n\\nThe server messed up our order, so we watched the vegetarian option be accidentally served to another group. Then the ramyuns came out one at a time...basically I just watched my partner eat his Ramyun until mine came out. It was also his birthday, and nothing happened, which was a little disappointing given the price and supposed prestige of this place.\\n\\nThe Toro was really good and very flavorful. I think the caviar is superfluous though and doesn't add much flavor to the dish. Rather, it just adds to the price. The dish is good, but very expensive.\\n\\nThe mushroom Ramyun was okay, but very one dimensional. It's one flavor throughout the whole soup and the only thing besides noodles in the Ramyun is mushroom.\\n\\nThe wagyu is absolutely not worth the price. It came out relatively lukewarm and had zero flavor, it needed more salt.\\n\\nOverall, I think you could get better ramen elsewhere at a better price point too.\", 'Jeju noodle bar is so vibey / sceney lol You lowkey feel like you\\'ve stepped some crazy rich asian scene hahaha \\n\\nif you want a resy you gotta look alive and \"waitlist at resy\" and then it\\'s pretty easy to get. i think the only thing worth getting is the torossam bap. like i would come JUST for that and nothing else. \\n\\n5 Stars for the Toro Ssam bap, (I had the ramen and chicken and didn\\'t think it was worth noting).', 'My family and I had a great time visiting JeJu Noodle Bar for a celebratory dinner. A five year Michelin star recipient, JeJu Noodle Bar specializes in innovative, Korean-inspired dishes and was surprisingly affordable. \\n\\nWe tried the:\\n- Toro Ssam Bap with Uni\\n- Jogae Muchim - Manila Clams & Sea Bream\\n- Scallop Hwe\\n- JeJu Fried Chicken with Caviar\\n- Ja Jang Style Ribs\\n- Kyung Yangsik Donkatsu\\n- Gajae Myun - Lobster with a Lobster Emulsion\\n- Lamb Ja Jang Myun\\n- Gochu Ramyun\\n- American Wagyu Ribeye\\n\\nWhile everything tasted amazing, I was most surprised by the Toro Ssam Bap, Scallop Hwe and Gajae Myun.\\n\\nThe restaurant does require a food & beverage minimum for parties of five and more, so I recommend trying this spot first with a smaller group. As a large group, we had the last seating of the day at 8PM.\\n\\nWith its unique menu, JeJu Noodle Bar is definitely worth a visit for the adventurous diner.', \"SOLID 5 out of 5. \\nI was BLOWN away by the dishes here. I've had some great food but I can confidently say that I'm blown away. This food is GREAT. Innovative to say the LEAST. Like I'm still dreaming about the scallops. If anything please pls get the scallops , especially if you are an umami girl like myself. \\nThe clams dish was heavenly. The trout was pretty good and quite filling. The lobster dish was equally delicious!\", \"Yes we were fully aware of this place being known for their ramen, but we came for their appetizers.  \\n\\nTik tok made us aware of their app that have caviar and uni all in one--of course we had to try it! It was so delicious! We also ordered their truffled scallops and their fried chicken that came with caviar. Our minds were blown. I've never been truffled and caviar'ed out ever in my life. Definitely was in heaven. \\n\\nReservation is a must here. Although not hard, but you do have to keep an eye out for an opening. OpenTable gives you options, and can notify you of an opening if you set it to. \\n\\nThis place was delicious!! 5 stars!!\", \"The service at Jeju Noodle Bar was excellent. The interior is dark, and although the restaurant isn't that big, the tables were spaced far enough apart. We ordered the toro ssam bap, ja jang style ribs, family ramyun, and the dessert. The toro ssam bap was delicious and included a generous portion of caviar and toro. The ribs were flavorful and came off the bone easily. The ribs also came with a small side of cucumbers and potato salad. The ramyun was only okay in my opinion and I probably wouldn't order it again. The dessert was ice cream with freshly shaved truffle at the table, and the flavors went well together. Overall a great meal and I will definitely be back!\", \"Went to Jeju Noodle Bar with some friends, and it was an absolute treat! We ordered the Toro Ssam Bap, Wagyu Ramyun, Family Ramyun, ribs, and fried chicken, and every dish was a so good!\\n\\nThe Toro Ssam Bap is a must-try! It was so flavorful and perfectly balanced. It's hands down my favorite dish of the night! The Wagyu Ramyun was rich and hearty, while the Family Ramyun had a comforting, homemade feel. The ribs were tender and packed with flavor, and the fried chicken was crispy and delicious. If you're a fan of Korean cuisine, you need to visit Jeju Noodle Bar. Can't wait to go back!\", \"If you love caviar, you can get plenty here. For Jeju fried chicken and toro ssam bap, they both have plenty of caviar that is served with it. We also got hwe neng-myun and gochu ramen. I actually really enjoyed hwe neng-myun. It is like cold noodle with assorted raw fish, and it's super flavorful and refreshing. The toro ssam bap is also another super popular dish here, and it is definitely delicious. Fried chicken is decent and combining it with the yogurt dip and caviar made it tastier! The staff is very attentive, and always refills our water timely. The ambiance is great there, and very nicely decorated.\", 'Solid Michelin-starred Korean ramyun spot. The restaurant is fairly average sized and isn\\'t too loud. Service was pretty attentive and quick.\\n\\nJeju features a menu of various Korean-inspired appetizers as well as a variety of noodle dishes as mains. They don\\'t have cocktails, but features a fairly impressive wine menu served alongside some beer and more traditional Korean options. \\n\\nOverall, I loved the appetizers here. The service sizes were large and presentation was great. I\\'d come back just to eat the toro ssam bap again. The wagyu ramen was just fine, but frankly, a bit too rich and one note for my taste. The lamb ja jang myun was really good, and the flavor of lamb permeated the dish. \\n\\nI like Jeju. I wasn\\'t especially wowed by it but it\\'s undeniable that the chefs here have great technique and the food is pretty solid. I think as one of the most affordable Michelin-star options in New York, it\\'s definitely worth seeking out and trying, but I found it kind of weird that for a \"Noodle Bar,\" the things that stood out weren\\'t really the noodle dishes.', \"For the hype around Jeju Noodle Bar, I was expecting more. Vibes were cute but service was lacking. After we were given menus, we sat without water for a long time before one of us asked for some. Given it was a hot day, perhaps the heat made us more irritable from the lack of water. But we really shouldn't have to ask. Ok let's get into the food: \\n\\nJeju Fried Chikin: Crispy, solid chicken. No complaints. Would be nice to provide some wet wipes for anyone using their hands. \\n\\nToro Ssam Baap: As their most popular dish, toro ssam bap is highly raved about. Texture was good and making your own seaweed hand roll is fun. My hot take is that slapping caviar on everything doesn't automatically make it taste good, but it makes it look good. It was very savory from the caviar and needed more to balance it out. \\n\\nGochu Ramyun: As many other reviews have said, for a noodle bar, the noodles are not worth it. Not sure what went wrong here. There are a ton of good ramen places in the city that has better noodles and broth. I would've loved to see a gogi-guksu on the menu. \\n\\nKyung Yangsik Donkatsu: This was my favorite bite of the night. Decently portioned, pork was tender and flavorful. The reduction and mushrooms were a nice touch. Although my Korean friends said they preferred the no frills donkatsu you get at casual spots.\\n\\nI give this a 3.5/5 overall. Maybe we need to try more of the menu but considering the Michelin star, limited reservations, and price, I would've expected every bite to be 10/10 but this was average at best.\", \"Worth the wait, or at least the lamb jajiang myun certainly is! Ribs starter and ceviche also finger licking good. \\nFamily style ramyun was nothing special compared to lamb jajiang. Wagyu bowl was pretty savory, but a bit too rich for my liking. \\n4.25 stars! I'll be back for just the lamb noodles again someday!\", \"What a letdown. We came hoping this would be the crown jewel of our new york gastronomic adventure. But alas, we were disappointed by the high prices for mostly mediocre creations. The staff weren't friendly and had a dive bar entrance greeting almost from the get go. Fried chicken was really crispy but didn't fit with caviar. Their star tartare dish is passable. Ramen was just ok. But their rice bowl exceeded expectations.\", \"Small nugget of a restaurant so be sure to make a reservation well in advance. \\n\\nUpon initial review of the menu, i wasn't sure if it would be as amazing as other reviewers have said, but it is not your traditional Korean cuisine and the dishes definitely have a luxurious fusion twist to them. \\n\\nWe ordered these items (listed from top favorite down):\\n\\n. Gochujang Bokum - comfort rice dish with hit of spice\\n. Toro Ssam Bap -  very fresh with tasty  accompaniments \\n. Truffle Scallops - seemed like a whole shaved truffle + even more truffle oil (this may come across as very oily/rich)\\n. Jajang Style Ribs - sweet ribs with great smoky flavor\\n. Jeju Fried Chicken - so crunchy and nice, big pieces\\n. Wagyu Ramen - tastes like Wagyu ramen\\n. Fluke Hwe - not my favorite\\n\\nNote: Parties of 5 or more have $150/person spend!\", \"Made rez a month ago by beating the bot. We weren't super hungry so we decided to get their two signature dishes:\\n\\n1) toro ssam - best bite we had in NYC. We upgraded to add uni and it was creamy and buttery. \\n\\n2) wagyu ramen - good, but not worth $49. Ichiran does the job for ramen for us. The Wagyu was tender tho.\\n\\nI would come again, except for the fact that they don't have a full drink bar. Just sake and wine.\", \"I was lucky to get reservations for 3:15pm on a Sat. I kept checking Resy for months and never saw an opening until one day I randomly found one!! I got seating at the counter but I highly recommend trying to get seating at a table. The counter seat was pretty uncomfortable because the chair had no back and I was just slumped in my seat. \\n\\nWe got the Toro ssam bap for our appetizer (it was abt $55, you can add uni for $19 but we did not)- this was absolutely delicious!! The ingredients paired perfectly. It came with seaweed to help hold everything together in one bite. I really enjoyed this but it was def pricey. I could have eaten this whole thing myself and then some but obviously my wallet would not be happy. \\n\\nFor my entree I got the gochu ramen ($23). It wasn't spicy to me but had a small kick. I added egg (not sure how much extra that was) but the soy egg was very good. Ramen was good too. I just think the broth could have used more flavor. It was a decent amount and had high quality ingredients. The ramen comes with some veggies, wood ear mushrooms, and pork belly (there was a lot of fat on the pieces which I liked but if you don't like fat then don't get this). I would try something else next time. My bf got another ramen and it came with foam on top. He said it tasted like parm and truffles and that he wished it came with more ingredients. \\n\\nService was attentive and ambiance was nice (good date spot). The place is kind of small so I think that's why it's so hard to get reservations. I think it is worth trying especially since they have a Michelin star. It's like a 6min walk from the nearest subway.\", \"Thursday dinner at 7 pm \\n\\n- Toro ssam bap, fluke hwe, fried chicken, family raymun, gochu raymun, lamb ha jang myun\\n\\nService: ok \\n\\nAmbiance: music too loud , dislike the vibe \\n\\nPrice: pricy \\n\\nFood quality:  fresh ingredients, the fried chicken was good, however, the rest of dishes  just missing wow factors, no excitement at all. So questioning where's the caviar came from??? It's way tooooooo below my expectations. I would stick with Korean food in LA instead. \\n\\nTable setting was inexpensive. Table lamp was so tenu level. Table and chair were uncomfortable. The entire meal was not enjoyable , it just a super super neutral dining experience. I don't think I will come back. Too overrated. Period!\", \"This was our second time at Jeju and it did not disappoint! We ordered the below: \\n- [ ] Toro ssam bop - super flavorful and refreshing. Our only frustration was that the waiter took away the nori before we were finished with it. \\n- [ ] Fried chicken - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The sauce it came with was incredible but truthfully the caviar was unnecessary. You could barely taste the caviar due to how flavorful the chicken and the sauce were. It should have been an optional add-on. \\n- [ ] Gochujang Bokum - for $13, this dish was super filling and delicious. It definitely had a little spice to it but had some great Koran inspired flavor. \\n- [ ] Wagyu ramyun - 10/10 - the Wagyu was delicious and thinly sliced and the broth was really creamy and flavorful \\n- [ ] Lobster myun - also delicious! Very rich and creamy\\n\\nWe wanted to order sake but they were sold out of the cheapest bottle and the next bottle was something like double the price. I'd encourage them to have some more reasonable options on the drink list.\\n\\nService was excellent; each dish came with an explanation of how to enjoy it. Our only frustration is that we asked if they could split the ramyun in the kitchen for us and they said no. It's a tricky dish to share so this would have helped a lot but we made do on our own. \\n\\nPricing came out to about $50/pp which was a bargain considering how much food we got!\", \"Wow! Finally got to try this place after trying for a long time to get reservations. The restaurant is located in a trendy area of West Village but the dining room is smaller on the inside than I expected. However, the atmosphere felt cozy enough for our party of four. Unfortunately, there's only one bathroom inside that doesn't have air conditioning for the whole restaurant. \\n\\nThe service was just ok, we had to wait around for our server to ask for more napkins, bowls, condiments, etc even though there were plenty of staff just standing around. Our reservation was at the beginning of their dinner service (5 pm) so they weren't terribly busy yet. \\n\\nOf the food we tried, the Toro Ssambap was definitely the stand out and it makes sense why it's their signature dish. Even though the dish looks small, we felt like it was enough to split among 4 people. \\n\\nOf the ramyun we tried, my favorite was actually the mushroom ramyun, a meatless dish, which I didn't expect. The broth was so creamy and rich. The Gochu ramyun and family ramyun were also solid so I can recommend those. The Donkatsu and Ja Jang ribs were middling for me and I would opt to try something else in lieu of those next time.\", \"Came 3 times! Finally reviewing. A lot has changed as it's inside only now. There was a super cute outside seating prior with great vibes.\\n\\nFood and ambiance are still great - service is spot on. The appetizers came super quickly.\\n- truffle scallop had a TON of truffle on it\\n- the seafood dish pepper taste was quite strong\\n- spicy ramen was very good; pork was a bit harder, would have been nice to have melted in your mouth\\n- lobster noodles are a more solid choice\\n\\nFeels like more of an upscale casual Korean restaurant. \\n\\nFavorite dishes are the ribs and ramen.\\nLeast favorite was the truffle scallop. Love scallop, but the truffle was overload. For truffle lovers, this is a must.\\n\\nOverall, solid restaurant, just some of the tastes are overly strong tasting.\", \"I was expecting to be blown away from this place given the wait and the prices but it honestly was just, not bad. We sat after a 1 hour wait for a seat for 2 at the bar and ended up spending $100 per person which included 1 beer a person.\\n\\nWe ordered the Chicken Wing + Caviar, the Toro Ssam Bap, Wagyu Ramyun and the Lamb Ramyun. \\n\\nFavorites were probably the Chicken Wing + Caviar (chicken was crispy, sauce was good and who doesn't love a good caviar dollop) just know that this is why it's expensive. If there wasn't caviar offered with the dish, I think I would've opt'd for that.\\n\\nThe Toro Ssam Bap was actually very delicious, the seaweed was very crispy but the price $50+ for this small appetizer leaves me wondering how much of a margin they have on this. \\n\\nThe Wagyu Ramyun was pretty rich, while the flavors weren't incredible, we ordered it because that's what was recommended by the staff, and while this is one of the most popular dishes there, it didn't blow me away.\\n\\nHappy to have tried Jeju Noodle Bar but the value isn't there for me.\"]}, {'id': 'mPHPVJ2-8mOR-lFHafrc6w', 'name': 'Evelina', 'image_url': 'https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hG3aShzVvdnbAFm02sQgZw/o.jpg', 'business_url': 'https://evelinabk.com', 'display_address': '211 Dekalb Ave', 'display_phone': '(929) 298-0209', 'rating': 4.4, 'reviews': ['The food is always fresh, plentiful and good.

White', \"Aesthetic brunch spot with Italian influence. Made a reservation online for three people at 10am on a Saturday a couple weeks in advance. There was a short wait but we got a large table on the patio. The issue with the patio was that the acorns dripping from the tree onto the roof were extremely loud and there was construction on the street, so that messed up the ambiance. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the company and the food, though on the smaller side, was nicely plated. We got the following: \\n\\nRicotta pancakes - these weren't too sweet and came in three, so it was perfect for our group to split. \\nShort rib - a solid plate that is good for sharing as well; the meat fell off the bone and came with buttery mashed potatoes. \\nPorcini ravioli - the best dish in my opinion - even our waitress prefers this over all the other pastas.\", \"Solid 4 stars.

Outside dining appeared bustling with diners and they even had a little stand where they sold frozen gelato!  I started to feel pessimistic about our chances of landing a table inside as I assumed this was a hot spot for brunch. However we were pleasantly surprised when we got inside there was a beautiful half empty restaurant where we were greeted and seated right away.

When I pointed out that we ,too, had a reservation she replied that that party had made theirs first .. which basically acknowledged that we did have a reservation.   Her tone was rude. Unapologetic. Dismissive. Unhelpful. Acted like it was our problem and she took NO responsibility for her incompetence.

I tried the Evelina cocktail (had to go for the signature) and it was light and very refreshing. We had several apps like the Pinsa Bianca and fried zucchini blossoms and everything was the perfect size to share. The highlights for food were definitely the perfectly cooked Ribeye and the Burrata Ravioli! The mushroom ragu on the ravioli really elevated the flavor and made the whole meal taste multi-dimensional! A great new discovery for me and I will definitely be back soon!', 'I came here on a date during the week, and since the weather was nice, we sat outside. We each had the Smoked Grapefruit cocktail; I liked it but my partner thought it was \"too syrupy,\" so he had them add Aperol to it. But I thought it was great as-is. We shared the Octopus as our starter and it was phenomenal. For my main, I ordered the sea bass with an extra side of fries. The sea bass was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I was a little disappointed that the fries weren\\'t hot when they came back, but they were perfectly crispy.

I was lucky to grab the only 5pm reservation left on a Saturday about a week in advance, which already let me know they stay booked and busy. We arrived a bit late but the hostess was quite nice about it and let us know they would just need the table by 7pm. The restaurant was packed and very lively, I did not see a table or bar seat empty during our stay. Despite this, service was sharp with staff routinely passing by to check on us and making sure everything was running smoothly. \\n\\nNow let's talk about the food! We decided to start with the Pinsa Bianca which included some type of airy pita bread with whipped ricotta and red peppers - very tasty overall. Next we had the octopus which was amaaazing - it was perfectly charred and had a flavorful citrusy combination of a grape-cherry vinaigrette, garlic, and pine nuts. It was really great and left us very excited for the next course. For mains, we ordered the short rib, cacio e pepe, and the oxtail pappardelle. Everything was scrumptious but the latter was definitely the star of the show. This pasta dish was just perfect and we liked it so much we ordered another plate. For dessert, we went with the classic choice of a tiramisu which we enjoyed. Drinks were also delicious - we tried the Evelina and Viola, both good choices. It looks like they change their menu every so often which I like a lot, you can always check what's on the table via their website. \\n\\nI will certainly be returning for brunch. & if you plan to visit at any point, please don't leave without trying the oxtail pappardelle! Thank me later.\", \"I'll start with the not-so-great and move towards the positives.  The service was slow.  Came here for dinner and it was about ~2 hours, mostly because we were waiting for food and the check.\\n\\nMinus the slow service, environment and food were fantastic.  Was pleased with just about everything on the menu.  The chefs in the kitchen had everything nailed down from the spaghetti with claims to the tiramisu.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a high-end vibe, but we came dressed in a fairly casual way.  Worth a visit for this neighborhood spot.\", \"Evelina is such a cute restaurant! It can get pretty cozy inside due to the spacing, but the food is delicious. We sat indoors as a party of 2 and although the table was near the access to the bathrooms I didn't mind the foot traffic or the lengthy line that was forming behind me. The cocktails were some of the best cocktails I've had so far in Brooklyn (and I might as well include Manhattan in this observation as well) I highly recommend Evelina for a cute date night or just a good dinner with a friend or two! I will certainly be returning this fall to see if there is a menu switch up.\\n\\nI also would like to add that I did not take a photo of the paperdelle ragu, but I was throughly impressed with how flavorful it was.

The only thing bringing it down is the speed of service. \\n\\nWe were seated immediately without a reservation on a Sunday for dinner. The indoor tables were taken so we were seated under a covered outdoor patio, which had overhead fans and speakers for music. I loved the ambience the table lights created--super cozy. I would love to try sitting indoors next time though since it looked very nice in there as well. \\n\\nI ordered the Radicchio Salad and the Cacio e Pepe. Both were great! Loved the pine nuts and dressing that came with the salad. In addition, my pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a great balance of pepper and cheese. I also stole a couple of bites from my husband's dish, which was an eggplant baccheri pasta with pesto and tomato sauce. That was delicious as well, especially the sauce. I actually left feeling comfortably full--the portion size looks small but was good enough for me. \\n\\nI also appreciated that our placemats, bowls and silverware were cleared between the salad and our entrées. However, they forgot to give us silverware when our entrées arrived, and we waited maybe 15 minutes for someone to come with the card payment system (took a while to make eye contact with a server to indicate we were ready to pay). So the ending of our experience wasn't great, but again, the food was amazing and I would return for dinner.\", 'The food & cocktails were so good! Definitely will be back-- the location is so cozy and get for a date night.', 'The service was very good by waiters and especially the person who was selling ice cream. Everyone was friendly. \\n\\nWe ordered few dishes of pasta which were good, but we especially loved the peach salad, and ice cream which tasted like as if you are in Rome! \\n\\nHighly recommend!', 'Everything was amazing! \\nFrom the host to the lighting. Everything we ordered was delicious.', \"This cozy, dim-lit restaurant serves delicious pasta dishes as well as some creative cocktails that will leave you wanting more. We stopped by on a Wednesday evening and while the dining room was full, the 3 of us were able to sit at the bar. The drinks were delicious, I got the Juliet which was heavy on the ginger so I loved it. For food we started with the fried zucchini flowers - too greasy in my opinion and wouldn't order again. I got the burrata ravioli which was sooo delicious, a mushroom lovers dream. Flavorful & cooked to perfection. The bass and Pappardelle were also really good. Skip the bass if you're hungry because it's a really light dish and probably won't fill you alone. I definitely recommend getting a pasta dish if you come here, seems like that's where they shine. Overall, a lovely restaurant and perfect for a date night or even solo dining.\", 'Excellent Excellent and Excellent breakfast (5+++ stars ) \\nService is great \\nAnd nice ambiance \\nIt looks well known for breakfast as we needed a reservation \\nDelicious and outstanding platters we get :\\nThe coconut oatmeal nicely served with banana, blueberries, coconut flakes\\nThe avocado toast is very tasty with vegetables and poached egg \\nThe lemon pancake is outstanding and tasty with fresh fruits and syrups \\nBreakfast sandwich is truly delicious ( scrambled eggs, salad, bacon and hot bread) \\nPlatters were unbelievable perfect !\\nPost card is a smart idea! \\nRecommended for sure ! \\nWill be back!', \"Traveling all the way down to Brooklyn, I am kinda pleased by my choice. \\nPlace is jammed on a Sunday night. Evelina seems to be a great dine-out spot for the community. Love the atmosphere foremost. \\nFoods are also good. \\nLove the zucchini blossom. Very unique but also certainly it is delicious cuz it's fried. \\nPasta are also legit. I had burratta ravioli as well as Ragu. Both are delicious but the downfall is that it is too salty that I kept drinking water. \\nOverall, nice neighborhood restaurants. Worth your time if you are in the neighborhood.\", \"Great food and excellent service at Evelina!\\n\\nThe inside feels warm and rustic. It's a little crowded, they definitely make the most of the space in terms of seating. Still, its a nice restaurant for a couple or a small group of 3-4.\\n\\nIn terms of food:\\n- The charred octopus appetizer was great, the octopus itself was grilled perfectly and had lots of zesty flavor. Other parts of the dish were a little meh.\\n- The pappardelle main stole the show, it was the best dish by far. The pasta was the definition of al dente, and the ragu added tons of savory flavor. So good.\\n- The risotto was a bit of a letdown. It was somehow both too creamy and too acidic at the same time, with very forgettable flavor.\\n- The tiramisu dessert was excellent, no complaints on a classic here.\\n\\nThe bar was also helpful with drinks, going off-menu to craft a cocktail based on taste preferences alone -- very impressive! Plus they have good wine available.\\n\\nSolid date spot for sure, but some menu items are a bit of a miss. Still worth a splurge for a nice, intimate meal!\", 'Friendly staff, lots of seating, and a wide variety of Italian options from Breakfast to Dinner. \\n\\nIve visited a handful of times and the place is always busy. I get why, they are really good at what they do. You will not regret visiting here and definitely ask about the specials!', \"I should have taken a photo! I need to do better. This place is cute. The staff was friendly, but I apparently dined with a regular there so I got lucky I guess lol. The oxtail pappardelle came recommended and sounded divine but I needed lighter lunch fare so the muscles were the winner for me with a glass of Lambrusco. This combination was lovely. The muscles are served in a light tomato based sauce which was tasty. Now I usually go for a white or butter sauce, but I enjoyed them, plus they were cooked to perfection. I would definitely like to go back and try the oxtail and go back again for the brunch for sure! The brunch menu looked so good! But that's for next time! (I hope!)\", \"Very cute Italian spot in Brooklyn. The atmosphere is chic and sexy. The food was delicious and although they were busy, we didn't wait long for our food at all. I ordered the oxtail pasta which was full of flavor and the meat was very tender. The pasta was made in house and complimented the oxtail very well.\", \"We had the Octopus, Fava Bean Salad, Beet Salad, Squash Blossoms, Ragu Pappardelle, & Scallops. Gorgeous presentation, exquisite flavors, food temperature was perfect. Our server, Cass, along with the Bussers and Food Runners, made sure we had everything we needed, and did so with friendly dispositions and smiles. The ambiance on-point with lighting, music, and everything. They were busy, but the hostess still managed to find a table for us even though we didn't have a reservation. EXCELLENT place! So glad we found it.\", \"Tables are a little tight but it's cozy. The service was great. The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything, server made recommendations as it was our first time. The food was good, nothing crazy tbh. I think the pasta could've been a little more al dente but the oxtail ragu was good, portion size was small for this dish. The tiramisu was good! I'd come back for a cute date night.\", 'Always delicious and the service is above and beyond. Try a drink with their house rosemary infused Cappelletti. So delicious. Also sweet patio areas weather permitting.', \"Evelina is a wonderful little restaurant in Fort Greene with a delicious menu that has something to please everyone. \\n\\nI came in on a Friday afternoon for lunch and was able to get a small table without a reservation. There were a good number of people there, but the restaurant wasn't packed. They had nice music playing at the perfect volume so you could hear people having conversations, and enjoying themselves. \\n\\nI ordered the seasonal Watermelon Basil Cooler cocktail and the Pappardelle Oxtail Ragú. The cocktail was strong but refreshing, and the Oxtail Ragú was delicious. I can see why it is a menu staple. The pasta was thick and hearty, and the oxtail was flavorful. I was pretty full after this dish. \\n\\nI would come back to try their brunch or dinner menu.\", \"Love this place. Great drinks and great food! Service was excellent as well! We stopped in as we were walking back to our hotel from my daughter's apartment. Glad we did!\", \"Absolutely fantastic restaurant. Whether it's brunch or dinner, this place often comes to mind first when I'm offering suggestions on where to eat on Dekalb avenue.\\n\\nStarting with the decor, Evelina takes up most of Adelphi's corner so there are many outdoor tables and half of them are well covered in case of inclement weather. There's also a gelato cart stationed outside during the warmer months. Indoor, the bar seats about 10 people comfortably and the tall-windowed walls allow for tons of lighting. Throughout the space there's also plants and booths with cleverly placed outlets.\\n\\nFor food, I have yet to have a bad dish. My favorites have been the Bavette Steak and the Mafaldine. For drinks, I typically stick with the Portia as that's also a favorite of mine. The only issue I've ever had is their wait time because it is so popular. If you're interested in trying this spot, I'd definitely recommend making a reservation or stopping by as soon as they open for brunch or reopen for dinner service. This is not a place you should miss.\", \"Evelina is a consistent neighborhood favorite, perfect for dates, taking your out of town friends, and dress up after work drinks and nibbles. The menu rotates with the seasons and their indoor/outdoor seating makes things very flexible for parents of kids and dogs. The space itself is beautiful and well thought out. There are heating lamps for the outside space and some cover in a light rain.\\n\\nI will decline to comment on specific dishes because the menu changes so much, but nearly everything I've had has been phenomenal. I especially love their pastas and gelatos. \\n\\nThere is very often a wait for walk ins. I highly recommend a reservation or showing up earlier than you really want to eat. Pricing reflects the slightly higher end crowd and ingredients. Service is attentive and friendly, and quick to make things right.\", \"Did dessert and espresso here and I'll definitely be back. There was a wait on a late Saturday but it was to be expected as the weather was beautiful in Brooklyn that evening. Evelina is a modern and airy space. I had the tiramisu and my gf has the bitter chocolate cheesecake. Both delicious and we devoured!

The place has a great ambience with lots of fun people. The bar is great and they are really busy. \\n\\nThe main thing is that the cocktails which are NYC expensive but quite a cool set of drinks. We loved the whiskey cocktails and it was a great way to get the party started. The pours a generous and they definitely a spending the time to figure out some really novel combination. \\n\\nThe service can be a little slow on a busy night like this, but they do a good job of keeping the dishes coming. We loved the various Chinese dishes. The best things were the Szechuan cold noodles which is a pretty classic disk. The Mung Bean jelly is definitely not something that you see in Chinese-American restaurants and you should give it a try. \\n\\nThe scallion pancakes are not that traditional but they are crispy and delicious And the potstickers are also great, but we didn\\'t come here because of the \"regular\" food but for something special. For that you should try the Lobster Szechuan style. This is a classic dish and it was well prepared (and expensive). We also liked the braised tofu with crab meat.\\n\\nThe best part has to be the desserts, we had this wonderful dessert with dry ice that literally unfolded itself. You are coming to Chilis for that kind of show. And we enjoyed it.', \"One of the top notch and delicious Chinese / Szechuan spots! We ordered: \\n\\n-jellyfish salad: super refreshing and flavorful. \\n-braised tofu with crab meat: very delicious and it tasted like salted egg was added to it which really enhances the flavor \\n-spicy cumin lamb: kind of remind me of the lamb skewers and it's a nice balance of meat and veggies that consist of onions and cilantro\\n-white style chungking braised fish stew: my favorite dish and practically fished the entire dish including the soup. The fish fillets were tender and the soup itself is flavorful and not crazy spicy which makes it really enjoyable. \\n\\nOverall service is quick and attentive. Great ambiance for both small and large groups.\", \"I found myself at Chili for a work holiday get together. I had never been here before, but one of my colleagues had good things to say so I was really excited to check it out - plus discovering a new spot is never a bad thing in my book. \\n\\nChili sits in Midtown East close to Murray Hill and K-Town. Like many other Manhattan restaurants, the space itself isn't too big; there's a bar towards the front of the restaurant with tables on the opposite wall, with more towards the back. The decor is kind of bright with soft blues and tasteful decor throughout the space. \\n\\nThere were 5 of us, and we decided to order everything family style to share. We started with some shrimp dumplings, wontons, and scallion pancakes. These were all good - tasty without being overly salty. We then moved onto mains - spicy lamb, spicy chicken, eggplant, and tofu. Again, everything was really tasty - I don't tolerate high spice levels but this was just enough heat where I was able to enjoy everything. We had a couple of rounds of drinks and I wouldn't overlook their craft cocktail menu - they were creative and tasty.\\n\\nService was good - we were told once seated there was a 90-minute limit which they adhered to as we saw a party waiting at the door as we were wrapping up. I think for a party of 5 that 2 hours would have been more appropriate, but I also understand that it's the holidays and they need to turn over tables. Overall, I had a solid experience at Chili, and would return to explore more of their menu.\", \"Pretty tasty place!\\n\\nMy sister scored reservations here on Christmas Day, and the second we walked into the restaurant, it smelled so damn aromatic. Beautiful ambience. I didn't want anything heavy, so I opted for the Fried Rice with Shredded Tea Smoked Duck and WOW. It was DELICIOUS. It also doesn't come with most of the extras I ask to be taken out of fried rice, like onions and stuff. Just rice, tasty duck, and egg (I asked for no scallions). I also got the jasmine tea, and they give you your own little teapot, but watch it, because the little cup you pour into gets HOT to the touch.\\n\\nMy mom got the Sweet and Sour Baby Ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone tender, melt-in-your-mouth good. The vibe was warm, cozy, and quiet, and they had what appeared to be delicious alcoholic beverages that I chose not to indulge in this time around, but I would certainly return!\", 'Came here on a Sunday evening for an early dinner with no reservation. Was grateful as our initial restaurant had a 1 hour wait. \\n\\nService was great - everyone was friendly and attentive. The restaurant was also nice and clean. \\n\\nOrdered a fair bit of dishes to share with friends. Really delicious and the spicy dishes definitely had a kick to it. Also ordered dumplings for kids and they were happy with it. \\n\\nVegetarian friendly as we came with our friends who are vegetarians.', 'I came by CHILI for a birthday dinner on a weekday night. We were a party of 9 and they seated us at a large square table which was nice because we could all talk to each other. We ordered a lot of food, from spicy cumin lamb and double cooked pork to the chongqing spicy chicken, green beans, eggplant in fish sauce, tofu, and fish soup. Some of the items were really yummy - my favorites were the spicy cumin lamb, double cooked pork, and eggplant. But some of the items such as the tofu and fish soup tasted a little starchy. The chili chicken was also really salty. \\n\\nI will add however the service was spectacular as we had this frozen cake which was impossible to cut and our waiter really went above and beyond to help us slice it into 9-10 pieces. They also put this huge lighter on top of our cake which was a lovely addition for the birthday. Would come again, great bang for buck!', \"Line was long on a Friday night but we timed the wait-list with our visit to nearby Morgan Library. Lots of spots to hang your jacket. W were seated near the back at a round table. Took a bit of time to flag down a waiter to take our order. We had 3 dishes: string beans, which were cooked perfectly al dented, pickled cabbage, which had a very authentic flavor; and the soft shell crab - delicious to the last bite. Steamed rice rounded it out. They really nailed the Sichuan peppercorn flavor there. If anything, food was a little heavy on the soy sauce. Otherwise, t'was a very cozy and yummy respite from the cold.\", \"This place is legitimately amazing. It deserves a spot alongside the legendary Cheli and Sichuan Mountain House.\\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n-Lamb dish: perfectly seasoned, nice cuts of lamb\\n-Fish stew: really steamy and tender pieces of fish\\n-Crab tofu: different from other places because they use salty egg which gives it more texture and flavor\\n-jellyfish salad: refreshing\\n\\nThe service was top notch - literally the entire meal came out in 5 minutes. Ambiance is amazing as well - I'll let the picture speak for itself.\", 'Very good, extremely dark on the wall banquets...some little portable lamps would be amazing.\\nThis is a bit of an upscale Szechuan style place tucked into a non descript side street. Pricey but very good, nice presentation. I was alone and headed to a show, so i could not order too much, so had the cold noodles which were a thinner noodle than I typically see and the string beans which were excellent but no where near spicy enough. \\nProbably better to go with a bunch of people to share many dishes.

We had an early dinner reservation (5pm on a Wednesday) but by the time we left at 7pm, the place was packed! The Bubble Dream Cocktail was crisp, tart, and strong! I enjoyed the bubble they put on your drink as soon as they give it to you. It's a playful moment they add to the experience. Since we were a party of 4, we decided to order a bunch of stuff and share it family-style. All the appetizers we got were solid! My favorite was the Beef Pancake Wrap. I could've easily eaten the whole thing on my own. I loved the crispy and flaky scallion pancake and the beef shank was tender and flavorful. The Sautéed String Beans had delicious flavor too. The entrees we tried were all good in terms of flavor and heat level. The Chungking Spicy Chicken was crispy and even without eating the actual chilis, it had a strong kick to it. The Truffle Beef Tenderloin was way smaller than we expected! There were more oyster mushrooms than diced beef tenderloin in this dish. I liked the black truffle oil infused in each bite but for the price tag, it didn't make sense to me. The Shredded Beef w Green Chili is not spicy at all and more on the sweeter side. I did like that they have Purple Rice as a side; it was moist and neutral in flavor which paired well with all the entrees we got. The Rice Wine Soup Dessert was such a unique try but I loved it! The rice balls were sweet, warm, and soaked in this wine soup. I enjoyed the red bean paste filling which toned down the sweetness a bit. 1 of those is definitely shareable among 5-6 people. We didn't even finish ours as a party of 4. Although I enjoyed the meal and experience, this will probably be a one-time try for me!\", \"I am sad to write this because this was my favorite Chinese (Shanghainese) restaurant for years, but as of late the quality of chicken and beef has gone down and I can't recommend it anymore.  The spices are on point.  And have a depth of flavor that is interesting and memorable.  There is a tall waiter who is exceptional and we trust whatever he recommends.  The ambience is kitschy, but it works. The rice wine dessert is a show stopper, but my partner prefers the chocolate mousse.\", \"Came in for an early dinner before a show. Everything was delicious. We started with lychee martinis, the beef pancake wrap and dumplings in chili oil - and we all agreed we could eat more of those! The cumin spicy lamb always one of my favorite, was delicious and while it had a nice kick it wasn't crazy spicy. The sautéed chicken filet with broccoli was light and flavorful. The staff was funny and helpful with suggestions.  Definitely on our list to come back to when we're in NY again.\", \"Had a reservation for a large party here, and we were shocked at how fast the food came out for our party of 12. I just love the aesthetics of the decor, it was very unique and super traditional (not in the sense of very coloring but muted turquoise color with old portraits and bookshelves, felt like we were dining in someone's house.  All the food was really good and pretty presentation, the tofu came out with steam I think from dry ice? Cocktails were yummy too. Very intimate vibes.\", \"Yummy schezuan food near times square! I was able to get seated right away when I came around 5:40 but as I left, it was definitely packed and people were waiting for tables. I really liked the twice cooked pork, it was the right amount of spice. Unfortunately I can't eat super spicy food anymore, like my mouth can handle it but my stomach says no :( so if you're old like me, where the mind is willing but the body says no- do not exceed one spice flame items on the menu or be prepared with pepto bismo. \\n\\nI also ordered the chrysanthemum cocktail cause I've never seen that as a cocktail before and was intrigued. Unfortunately it wasn't my cup of tea (see what I did there), I think for what it is, it's a well made cocktail but I personally prefer cocktails where you can't taste the alcohol and this one was tasting more alcohol than tea. Which I guess is more bang for your money but it was honestly hard to drink. This might appeal to some people though\", \"This place is always lined up outside during dinner time if you don't have a reservation,  there are only a few seats by the bar. \\nI came here for lunch and they have a reasonable lunch special. The restaurant serves Szechuan style, which tends to be more rich in sauce and on the spicy side. The food was delicious. And the server is very attentive. I recommend this place for a date night.\", 'Everything was exceptional! Makes sense the chef has a Michelin star. We did family style and recommend doing that so you can try as many dishes as possible :)', \"My daughter took me here and wanted to eat dinner. We waited a few min and got a table. It's a nice atmosphere inside the restaurant and full of customers.  All the staff at the restaurant are pleasant and the service is good. We ordered Dan Dan Noodles, fish dish, smoked duck, and white rice.\\nDan Dan noodle was good taste and the staff skillfully mixed noodles and sauce. But this noodle dish was simply just noodle and chili flavor sauce. I forgot the name of the menu, but it was a white fish dish, but it was delicious when I ate it with rice. We were disappointed that smoked duck was full of bones and small meat. We didn't enjoy it. \\nWe want to try other dishes next time.\", \"One of my new favourite Sichuan restaurants in the city! \\n\\nI was able to make a reservation for a party of 8 people the week of which is typically unusual. But the food is some of the best Sichuan food I've had in the city and quite affordable too!\\n\\nThe service was fast and I loved the decor inside too. It was a little hot inside the restaurant but other than that I absolutely loved this place and will def b recommending it to friends!\", 'When I asked where he sent the hotel guests, the concierge gave some restaurant recommendations. I asked him a slightly different question: Where does he take his buddies and he said...Chili. \\n\\nThere was 30 minute wait but it was well worth it. Super flavorful Chinese food. I over ate and did not even realize it. The fish fillet was like eating butter and the chicken with broccoli and egg fried rice were super flavorful. The ladies at the front desk were great and service was prompt.  5 stars!', \"I loved this restaurant's elevated take on Chinese foods you can get around Manhattan, the service was quick and friendly.  I recommend going to this place if you are in the area and want good Sichuan food.\\n\\nAll of the food that we ordered was fantastic, everything was full of flavor and just the right amount of spice. the cocktail selection was also great. My favorite thing that I tried was the Three Pepper chicken, but I can't wait to go back and try more of their entrees.\", 'Came here on a Thursday night and my friend and I were quickly seated. The drinks look amazing here and I wanna try them next time but this time we were hungry and ordered a huge feast. \\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of veggie friendly items and the Sichuan cold noodle and the scallion pancake are must orders! The perfect size and so delicious. The eggplant was incredibly flavorful and garlicky but I would skip the chengdu mushroom and the mung bean noodle was just ok. Overall though delicious food and great service! Will definitely be coming back to get my spice fix!', \"I was thoroughly impressed with this place. I came here for a work dinner and this place was very packed! We ordered a lot of shareable family style. Both the noodle dishes looked like the would lack flavor but was pleasantly surprised on the first couple slurps. The green veggies that we ordered were both rich in garlic and marinated sauce, giving it a savory taste to them - perfect to snack on as I got so full from the entire meal. For meats, we ordered a beef and chicken dishes and the chilis were such a refreshing and spicy kick to it all. This is overall such a good spot for a cuisine that doesn't stray too far from its traditional taste - it's not unique or eccentric but this is one of my new favorite Chinese spots.\", \"We are thrilled that we found this fantastic Chinese restaurant  during our trip to NYC.  It's a small, beautifully decorated establishment with friendly and attentive servers. The food was out of this world.  I can't recommend it enough. It has been hours and we are still talking about it!  \\n\\nThe spicy wonton soup had a unique flavor. I learned it was a Szechuan peppercorn.   It sort of made my mouth tingle kind of like mint would, but there was no minty taste. I can't speak highly enough about it. Please try the spicy wonton soup if you go.  We also had the Dandan noodles, cucumber salad, and the shredded pork and garlic sauce. Everything was superb. We have been here for five days and this was by far the best dinner we have had.  Somehow, it was also the least expensive. Seriously, what more can you ask for?  Chili deserves all the recognition it gets. For real!\", \"It's a pretty popular spot, I recommend coming here if you like spicy dishes like Sichuan cuisine. They have a nice selection of cocktails as well. We didn't make reservations but the wait was about 30 min for a Thurs night dinner. It was pretty crowded and popping inside. \\n\\nWe got some apps to share: the cucumbers and mouth watering chicken. The mouth watering chicken is pretty good, slight kick. It reminds me of hainanese poached chicken but with a spicy sauce. I would get this again. For entrees we shared the soft shell crab (this dish was pretty spicy but still enjoyable), ma po tofu (classic) - came with a lot of sauce to put over rice, and  shredded pork in garlic sauce. Everything pairs really well with rice since there is a decent amount of sauce. I would try the fish fillet next time. Service is fast and attentive.\", \"Awesome experience at this restaurant! A hidden gem! \\nWe asked the waiter to help decide with some favorites and were satisfied! All dishes are shareable if you want to try multiple things. Drinks are decent and flavors don't disappoint! Check it out!\", \"I'm not one to eat spicy foods, but this place is very good. The absolute must is the fried garlic lobster. I think about this dish weekly. Aside from that, we did do a couple shared cold apps like the pork which was cut into thin ribbons and the chicken. We loved the string beans. For the mains the dan dan noodles were also very good. But like I said, the lobster was the star of the show. I can barely remember all the other dishes because this was so good. Also interesting cocktail list. Unfortunately I didn't find anything that I liked in particular, but my friends like their drinks a lot.\", \"Came here for lunch on a Friday with a friend, the place wasn't too busy and I was seated immediately. The lunch specials are such a great deal!! Interior is very modern and hip, I hear it might not be great for large groups because of noise levels. I was really impressed with the food, the three pepper chicken was quite spicy.\", \"Had to come try CHILI after hearing about it from Yelp Top 100 (in 2024)! Overall, I had a good experience with some classic dishes - sour fish soup, scallion pancake with beef, crab egg tofu, and chestnut braised pork (seasonal).\\n\\nThe soup I felt was more on the sour side of the dish, just so you're aware! Everything else was as expected. Thought the food was good and would come again if someone else wanted to try it.\", '3.5 stars rounded up\\nAfter a long day getting ready to head home, we were discussing how hungry we were and as we were getting ready to head home we passed down this street where the scent of food just wafted towards it. It smelled like some really good Asian food and there was just some mention of wanting something along those lines. We saw there were two restaurants right across from each other and just tried to follow our nose to determine where the delicious smell was coming from. \\nWe checked out the menu and Chili was the choice for the day. We were seated right away and the restaurant had a few people scattered throughout.  Our waiter came over not long after. The server seemed made us feel like we needed to rush the entire time we were there. And any questions we had he said they didn\\'t do. They weren\\'t outlandish things either. One was can the broccoli we ordered only be lightly steamed- \"We can\\'t do that\". The other was Can I have light sauce on the broccoli?  \"We can\\'t do that\". By the end I was very sure that it was very specifically whatever is exactly on the menu is exactly and only what they do. \\nI wanted to take more time to browse through the drink menu but the waiter was in such a hurry so I ordered something called a Floral Wave ($18). I don\\'t even remember getting the drink but perhaps I did and didn\\'t get a photo and it just wasn\\'t memorable. \\nI got the Spicy Cumin Lamb: lamb with cumin, chili peppers, onion and cilantro ($30.00)- the lamb was nice on its own and the spice was good but to me the cumin overpowered everything and took away from what could have really been a delicious dish. \\nThe other dish ordered was the Shredded Beef with Green Chili ($25). That was pretty good! Very tasty and well seasoned. We also ordered Purple Rice ($3) and Chinese Sautéed Broccoli ($18) because the entrees did not come with sides on their own. The Purple rice left much to be desired and I have had much tastier Purple rice elsewhere.  Maybe it\\'s just because this one seemed to be so overly mushy.. The broccoli was good. They seasoned it well ans it worked out as is. \\nThe waited never bothered coming back until we flagged down someone else to get boxes to go and then he came over to give the check. I was paying for the check with my card and the other person in the party was handing the waiter a cash tip. The waiter saw the amount did not look like enough to cover the bill and started shaking his head no. I\\'m sure it\\'s not because they didn\\'t accept tips since there was a tip line on the check. Then I had to break it down  that the check was being paid by card and the tip was going to be issued in cash. At that point I honesty felt like what were we even tipping for? \\nThe positive moments here didn\\'t outweigh the negative for me. Not a place I\\'d go running back to based in this experience.', 'Pretty solid Chinese food. The restaurant gets packed so try to get a res. My favorites were the fried fish and the spicy chicken.', \"I live 2500 miles to the West of here, in a Central Oregon town without a single good Chinese restaurant, so I depend on business travel for my Asian food hankerings. I keep coming back to Chili because it fires on all cylinders. Craft cocktails. Flavorful dishes with that extra touch that helps put it in a close-to-Michelin category. Tonight was my fourth visit. It won't be the last. \\n\\nEverything is good, but the Spicy Cumin Lamb is off the charts.\", 'CHILI in New York, NY.

Thank goodness we made a reservation and were able to sit down with 2 people in our party being late. \\n\\nThe restaurant had great decorations and there were many seatings. However, if you have a big party it might be slightly uncomfortable. But the delicious food makes up for it. Each person on my table order a drink and we had many appetizers and entrees. All the food presentations were off the charts. The chefs put so much effort to make the food look so nice and yummy. My favorite dish was the truffle beef. IT WAS SO GOOD! My party reorder it 3 times because it was that good. At the end, each person in my party paid about $76 each (we did order so much).', 'Came here for an early dinner on a Sunday and was seated right away without a reservation. I came with one other person and we shared the dan dan noodles and mapo tofu. The mapo tofu had a bit of a kick to it, though not as spicy as I would have liked. We each ordered a bowl of white rice to have with the mapo tofu. Food was flavorful. This was enough food for us as we indulged in a whole day of eating before coming here. But I do think the portion sizes were a bit small here. \\n\\nService was very good. The staff was attentive and my water cup never went empty. I definitely want to come back here in the future with an emptier stomach so I can try more dishes!', \"I stopped here for soup since I had some work done on my teeth.  Ended up leaving a happy customer with a full belly!  Excellent decor and soup dumplings as well as their new bean soup.  The only drawback I'd say was some smudges on my glass for ginger ale.  Staff were very friendly and attentive at all times.  Would definitely come back !\", \"I wanted to make my landmark 1000th someplace special and that's what this place was. Some of the best Chinese food ever. \\n\\nWhen I first heard where we were going I thought my daughter had made the reservation for our party of 10 at Chili's.  This is Chili without the S. \\n\\nThe staff there was so accommodating to our relatively large party.  The place has a much cooler vibe than your typical Chinese restaurant. \\n\\nWe ordered a lot of dishes and just about everything was a 99 yard kickoff return.  Not using a baseball analogy this time around. \\n\\nSome of the dishes we loved were the Kung Pao Chicken, Mr. And Mrs Smith which was a cold appetizer of beef and tripe, Crispy Shrimp, several outstanding dumplings and vegetables, Ribs. The biggest touchdown was a Crispy Shrimp dish that may have been a special. \\n\\nI advise you to check out their menu. Their pictures don't lie.

The interior is clean and feels nice without being too upscale.  This could be a great place for a date or business dinner (if your colleagues can handle some heat), but I\\'d go just for the delicious food.\\n\\nEverything sampled was delicious, but let\\'s talk about the superstars at CHILI - the Truffle Beef Tenderloin and Braised Tofu with Crab Meat.\\n\\nFirst, the Truffle Beef Tenderloin is simple but incredible.  With unbelievably tender beef and an outrageously good truffle umami punch, this is a dish for which you\\'ll be fighting to take the last bite.\\n\\nThe Braised Tofu with Crab Meat is unreal in both presentation and flavor.  Served in a beautiful tiered stone bowl, the servers activate dry ice the surrounding lip for a fun smoke show. The tofu is jiggly and tender with generous portions of sweet crab that will fulfill your savory dreams. This is sure to impress any special guests.\\n\\nAdditional highlights include the Mapo Tofu, which also comes with jiggly, delicious tofu but with an almost creamy spicy sauce full of flavor.  The Dan Dan noodles are also mildly spicy but have an amazing sesame sauce and provides a mild numbing kick.  The Spicy Wontons are delicate and plump while also bringing the chili.  \\n\\nThe Fried Rice, Green Beans, and Kung Pao Chicken are all delicious accompaniments to your main meal as well. If you\\'re going to try their dessert, the Rice Wine Soup not only has another cool dry ice presentation, but the chewy little balls of black sesame/red bean paste is delicious.\\n\\nBeyond the amazing food, the drinks are great (my favorite was the Spring Fever with vodka, Saint Germain, lemon juice, Basil leaves, and egg whites), and the service is on point.  Even with busy service, multiple servers checked in on our table in rotation, and it was pretty easy to capture their attention for requests.  Also, for what it\\'s worth, the spice levels aren\\'t too bad (think 3-5 out of 10).\\n\\nLet\\'s just say, CHILI earned its spot as the only New York restaurant on Yelp\\'s Top 100 this year.  Fantastic experience; would highly recommend it!', 'Chili serves up the perfect authentic Sichuan experience. The ambiance was welcoming and cozy, especially on a chilly night! The service was attentive and fast, with our water glasses constantly refilled and the food served to our table in no time!

The aromaticity of the food hits you right when you walk in and the parade of dishes around you gets you excited for your meal. Every dish was well made and tasted amazing! Highlights are the crab tofu and chingking spicy chicken. Service was also very prompt, no empty water cups on the table. It's a well decorated, intimate place. Would definitely come back and try more things on the menu! Like the duck or truffle tenderloin.\", \"Food?! Incredible, authentic, Thanksgiving in NYC from this Texan was spent in this lovely restaurant with the beautiful authentic stained glass lamps and beautiful soft green walls, and eclectic music.   Full of locals, the pork dumplings started us off with mouthwatering tenderness and a wonderful ton soup along side.  Following up with twice cooked pork over sticky rice completed our wonderful meal along TsingTao beers and Lychee Martinis.   It's lively, nonstop, attentive waiters are what completed this lunch away from traditional Thanksgiving at home and the full NYC experience.   It's a feeling of nostalgia and warm authentic Chinese delicacies at reasonable prices that will warrant a return visit from me anytime!!!\", \"I have to start by saying this is not a review of the food, as it was excellent. I visited Chili for lunch on November 14th and was impressed with the quality of the dishes. I ordered two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc ($13 each), Dan Dan Noodles ($11), Spicy Wonton ($11), and the lunch special Three Pepper Chicken ($16) - (picture included here). The total, including tips, came to approximately $75, which I was happy to pay given the great experience.\\n\\nHowever, when I checked my credit card statement, I discovered I was charged $125 instead of $75. This discrepancy was very disappointing. I've since disputed the charge with my credit card company and am waiting to see how it gets resolved.\\n\\nWhile I truly enjoy this restaurant and the food, this issue has left me feeling frustrated. Mistakes can happen, but they undermine trust. I hope this is resolved quickly and doesn't happen to others. If you dine here, I recommend keeping an eye on your credit card transactions.\\n\\nFood: 5/5\\nExperience: 2/5 (due to billing issue)\", \"Had a great experience at CHILI.

The tofu was slightly more firm than traditional silken and I liked their version better.

Went on a Tuesday evening and it was pretty busy; unfortunately they only allow reservations for parties 4 and above. Food was good, if not amazing. My favorite was definitely the mouthwatering poached chicken appetizer-- that chili sauce? Absolutely addicting. Would 100% order again. The spicy/sour fish stew was alright but more sour and much less spicy than other versions I'm used to. Fish was fresh though. Would probably not order that one again as I've had better elsewhere.

By the time we left, tables were full, and hopeful walk-ins were getting turned away. So, plan ahead!\\nLet's talk about the drinks:\\nThe cocktails -- both spirited and non-alcoholic -- are as unique as they are refreshing. My Anar Sour hit that perfect tart-meets-smooth note, while my dad savored the lemon and saffron Persian cooler. A solid win on both fronts.\\nThe food? A parade of deliciousness. Here's what we shared:\\nBrûléed Sweet Potatoes: The texture, the caramelization, the flavor -- a table favorite.\\nShiraz Style Salad: A fresh, classic counterbalance to heavier dishes. Light, bright, and welcome.\\nMedjool Date & Lentil Rice: Unique and layered with flavor. Comfort food, Persian-style.\\nSofreh's Bread: Freshly baked and a reliable sode\\nSmoked Eggplant: Chef's kiss. My personal favorite of the night -- smoky, silky perfection.\\nThe ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a trendy 3-dollar-sign Brooklyn gem -- modern, bustling, and effortlessly cool. Service kept up with the evening's energy: quick, efficient, and friendly.\\nIs it my favorite Persian spot in NYC? Eyval still holds the top spot in my heart (their bread game is next level), but Sofreh comes in close, and the overall experience is one I'd happily repeat.\\nPro tip: Book your table, savor the food, and roll yourself into the twinkling lights of BBG fully content.\", 'This is a beloved and hyped place - felt there were hits and misses. Favorites - pomegranate glaze/marination of the steak (\"kebab\"). Eggplant and bread were delicious. Drinks/dessert were tasty. \\n\\nCould be improved - the roasted cauliflower leans extremely acidic, and is really more a pickled cauliflower. Steak itself was a bit overcooked. A lot of the naming on the menu is a bit misleading. Overheard the waiters constantly having to explain how something on the menu was not what was described - for example, the stew is really more a rice dish. The kebab is a steak, etc. \\n\\nThe ambiance is warm and romantic. Service was so so for a more elevated place. \\n\\nWould be down to visit again, but might prefer doing drinks/snacks at the bar instead. Overall for dinner felt just ok for the price point and needing to get a pretty late reservation.', \"Came in as a walk in about 5-10 min before opening time on a Saturday and was the second group seated at the bar. Bar seats filled up in under five minutes so if you want to walk in, you need to be there at least 10 min before. There's about eight bar seats. We were told we had the table until 7:30 (so two hours). \\nUnfortunately the meat is not halal but there were vegetarian options available. I assumed as much. I called but they don't have a human being answering the phone so I couldn't get confirmation before making the trip. To be fair, I don't know why I even bothered coming when the meat wasn't even halal and plenty of other halal Persian restaurants exist and have the decency of being inclusive. (Also because they're offering the same food for a lot cheaper). The gentrified area answered plenty of questions for me.\\nOne thing to note is that you need to order all your food in one go so make sure you take plenty of time to deliberate before putting in the order. \\nThe portions are pretty small but we were warned ahead of time when we were ordering only a couple dishes. I really loved the shallot chive yogurt and it was a good size. It also came with freshly made bread. The ash reshteh was enough for one person. The bastani was icy cold and needed some time to soften and melt before consuming. I'm glad I tried everything I came into try but I definitely will be exploring Persian food at other restaurants that are halal as opposed to coming back here. I'm probably just not bougie enough. \\nBy the way none of the menu items are referred to by their actual names and are just broken down by WHAT they are (ex: ashreshteh was basically green herb noodle soup). I wish they had both listed just cause I wanted to know the actual name of what I was eating.\", \"Sofreh has been on my list for quite a while and I finally make it there last night. \\n\\nTheir menu is filled with intriguing dishes and I was lucky to get to try quite a few. Here's what we ordered: \\n\\n- Roasted Cauliflower \\n- Feta & Herbs Flatbread \\n- Tahini & Date Salad \\n- Saffron Rice \\n- Smoked Eggplant \\n- Roasted Cabbage  \\n\\nEverything was flavor and delicious! My favorite was definitely the Feta & Herbs flatbread. \\n\\nService was attentive and friendly. The salad and bread arrived promptly, while the other dishes took a while longer. Just something to keep in mind if you're pretty hungry.\", \"As a Persian and a lover of Persian cuisine, I knew I had to visit Sofreh in Brooklyn, NY when I found out about it from Persian news anchor Shally Zomorodi 2 years ago.\\n\\nThe restaurant's limited hours only open for 4 hours in the evenings and closed on Mondays caught us by surprise, so reservations are essential. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated on the outdoor patio to enjoy the pleasant New York weather. Sofreh offers various seating options, including a private dining area downstairs.\\n\\nThe menu was concise and offered some intriguing Persian fusion dishes. For appetizers, we chose the eggplant dip and crispy rice. For our main courses, we had the half chicken and dried lime beef stew. The food presentation was 10/10. The dishes were delicious, with the apricot sauce accompanying the chicken standing out as a highlight. We finished our meal with a Persian ice cream sandwich, which was a perfect sweet ending.\\n\\nThe only downside was that our waiter wasn't as pleasant as we had hoped and seemed irritated by our presence at times. Despite this, we enjoyed our meal.\", 'Everything about this spot was phenomenal. The space was warm and inviting, the service was attentive and efficient, and the food was overwhelmingly flavorful and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend the chicken. We also ordered the lamb ribs that were so tender and juicy. The bread is a must as well. For dessert, we opted for the rose and saffron ice cream.', \"I've been trying to come here for a long time. The venue is simple, but nice. Upstairs was loud. We sat in the basement and it was perfect. Quiet and empty other than one other group. Everyone enjoyed the lamb shank, eggplant, beet salad and catch of the day. Considering it's a sharing menu, I'd say the fish portion was a bit small. Lamb was perfect size and flavor. Everyone enjoyed their cocktails and I liked my wine. Pricing was good and waitress was knowledgeable about the menu. \\n\\nThe butternut squash dish was just ok and we could have skipped.\", \"It wasn't super hard getting a reservation for 8pm if booked weeks in advance. The restaurant is on the smaller cozier side with a large downstairs that may only be for events.\\n\\nWe had drinks. I liked that they offered house wine too.\\n\\nWe enjoyed several apps including the cauliflower, meatballs, eggplant dip. The acorn salad was refreshing. \\n\\nThe duck, chicken and steak entrees were so well done. Flavors were present without any grease! I didn't feel disgustingly full after.\\n\\nWill definitely be coming back!\", 'Excellent service and dining environment. I was really excited when I managed a reservation here. The staff were attentive and noted our dietary restrictions.\\nThe restaurant is modern and had a fun Iranian film wallpaper in the bathroom.\\n\\nWe started with the eggplant whey dip which was really tasty. Really enjoyed this with the bread that came with it. We shared the herb rice and both had separate entrees. I had the half chicken and my friend got the lamb shank. The lamb fell off the bone and was delicious, the chicken was good, but lamb shank was great.\\n\\nI enjoyed my time at Sofreh and you will too.', 'This place might be my favorite restaurant in New York. The chicken had no business to be as juicy as it was, and the lamb shank basically fell off the bone. Not to mention the service was excellent.\\nI would absolutely come back here and try everything that I did not get do not sleep on the vegetable dishes each and everyone was amazing.', 'Great iranian food. Had the jerusalem bagel, cabbage wedge, and smokey eggplant. We had a reservation and got the bottom room which was nice', \"If you wanna try some of the best Persian food in NY, Sofreh is the place to go. \\n\\nFor me, Sofreh wins the battle of best Persian restaurant in NY. The food was better tasting (close though), the service was miles better, cleaner setting, and the general experience I had was just better.. more chic and authentic. \\n\\nWent without a reservation and got a walk-in seat at the bar - lucky. The watermelon feta salad was tasty and very refreshing. The lamb slid off the bone like butter. Slightly oily but it also could've been from the bone marrow. The ghormeh sabzi was authentic and everything it should be, had all the right flavours; A MUST. The dessert is what made it for me. Persian ice cream sandwich was to die for. Again, all the right  mouth-watering flavours reminding me of Iran; A MUST. \\n\\nGot tahdig as a side and they brought it before the mains which was weird. Not to mention they didn't give very much rice or tahdig - Eyval was more generous with their portions and better tasting for both rice and tahdig in my opinion. \\n\\nManager was a nice Persian man (surprise) and seated us - was very kind. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly throughout the meal - helped guide through the menu. Amazing atmosphere - buzzing and full on a Friday night. Restaurant and bathroom were super super clean and very very chicc!\", \"Returned to Sofreh after a hard-earned reservation. We visited when it first opened and were eager to come back. The hostess took us downstairs to a small communal table. I appreciate the desire to maximize space and the owners attempt to make the space inviting but it was akin to being in a church basement. As others have mentioned, sound carries here so it was hard to have a conversation without hearing every word of your neighbor's. Our waitress was exceedingly friendly and helpful with suggestions, actually all the employees we encountered were welcoming and efficient. We ordered the eggplant dip (excellent), maitake mushrooms (bland), the beef stew (delicious and tender), the Persian salad (tangy and a good complement to the stew), and a side of yogurt. The saffron rice was unremarkable. So a mixed review on the food overall. If we were seated upstairs maybe we'd give it a third try.\", 'I really enjoyed my meal here! For starters, we had the eggplant dip and cauliflower. Both dishes were full of flavor. The eggplant came with fresh bread. For mains we had the herb and noodle stew / \"ash\" and the beef stew which were flavorful as well. The ash was new to me and I throughly enjoyed it. Cocktails menu had a good variety and we enjoyed the 3 we tried. Service was attentive and friendly. Our serve had good recommendations. Restaurant music was great! Learned a few new songs.', \"We made a reservation for two and they had us sit at the end of a long table with a bunch of people already sat there, and when I asked for a different table they said that's the reservation I made. The hostess was also very rude.\", \"I loved this place and would definitely visit again! I should not that I had a late dinner here after a day of traveling, so I didn't try as many dishes as I would normally try. \\n\\nFood: I savored the Eggplant and Whey Dip, a symphony of roasted eggplant, crispy onions, cured whey yogurt, and mint oil that danced on my palate with exquisite flavor. The Roasted Cauliflower, adorned with a tantalizing tomato & chili glaze, shallot yogurt, pickled vegetables, and pistachio, offered a delightful journey through contrasting textures and bold flavors. Lastly, the Medjool Date & Lentil rice transported me to the heart of Persia with its aromatic Basmati rice, infused with raisins, lentils, cinnamon, saffron, and crispy onions--a comforting embrace of authentic flavors.\\n\\nService: The service at the restaurant was top-notch! The staff were so friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. They really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and taken care of. It definitely added to the cozy vibe of the place and made our dining experience one to remember!\\n\\nVibe: The vibe of this place was just perfect - laid-back yet inviting, with a clean and comfortable atmosphere that immediately put me at ease. It had this effortless charm that made it feel like a home away from home. The simplicity of the decor combined with the casual ambiance created a relaxing environment where I could truly unwind and enjoy my meal.\\n\\nI can't wait to get back to New York and try more items at SOFREH!\\n\\nDate of Visit: 15 March 2024\", \"Finally made it to Sofreh and I thought it lived up to the hype!\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\n-Eggplant and whey dip (roasted eggplant, crispy onions, cured whey yogurt, mint oil): my understanding is that this is a traditional Persian appetizer also called Kashke-e Bademjan. I thought it was very good. The combination of the eggplant, onions, and the whey made for an acidic, creamy, tangy, pulpy delight. The flavor of the kashk (whey yogurt) is unique and really stands out. \\n\\nRoasted cauliflower (tomato and chili glaze, shallot yogurt, pickled vegetables, pistachio): excellent. many competing elements come together to make a tangy, nutty, creamy, spicy, wonderfully flavorful dish. \\n\\nLamb shank (braised lamb, butter beans, dill and dried lime broth): fall-off-the-bone lamb. I ate the least of this I don't remember too much about the sauce other than that I liked it and it reminded me of other lamb dishes I've had. \\n\\nSaffron rice: our server actually recommended another rice to pair with the lamb, but I had heard such good things about this rice and - oh my goodness. THIS WAS THE DISH that finally got me to understand just how incredible saffron is. Every bite was just delicate, perfumed heaven.\\n\\nPistachio, rose, cardamom, creamy vanilla - I mean, all of the best flavors of Persian cuisine brought together subtly in an ice cream?! Yes, please. Rose water-flavored desserts are my absolute jam. I would order this 1,000 times over. \\n\\nThe don't remember the specifics of the cocktails, but I thought they were great.\\n\\nThe interior was trendy, inviting, and adds to the overall feeling of this being a destination restaurant. The bathroom was fun. The service was nice enough, not especially warm, but no problems.\", 'Thank you for accommodating us last minute. The lamb was next level!! Everything from apps to drinks to mains/entrees were off the charts. 10/10!', \"My meal here was incredible. Reservations can be hard to get. Make them a month in advance, go with a group, and order everything. The meal is served family style so going with a group will let you try everything.

Can't wait to return.\", \"Food (4.5/5)\\n- Great food! Definitely shareable\\n- My party of 3 shared the lamb shank, kebab, ice cream, tahdig, eggplant and whey dip.

At first we were seated downstairs (no one else was down there) then moved outside on a 90 degree day even though we asked to be moved on the normal floor since there was more than 4 tables empty inside upstairs the whole time we were there. The flatbread was yummy, salad was good, carrots ok, rice ok, stew good but it tasted like something I could've made. Veggie options limited.\", \"I came in with pretty high expectations, and for good reason. The place has a cozy atmosphere, and the service was great, but it does get a little loud. The lamb was fantastic, and I liked the date and tahini salad, though it was a bit too heavy on the dressing for my taste. The bread and yogurt were just okay, and I wouldn't get the tahdig again. The yogurt custard was a pleasant surprise since I'd never tried it before. That said, the prices are pretty steep.\", \"All-around excellent meal! Had been hearing good things about Sofreh for a long time, so made a reservation 30 days in advance to come for a birthday dinner. It seems to be booked up every night, so a reservation is definitely necessary.\\n\\nThe menu is perfect for sharing multiple small dishes, which works out because there are so many interesting things to try. We ended up starting with the eggplant and whey dip appetizer and date salad. The eggplant dip was probably my favorite dish of the night - creamy, savory, and the fried shallots added a nice crunch. The date salad was also good, but spicier than expected so be warned!\\n\\nOur entree was the other eggplant dish on the menu, the smoked eggplant with poached eggs. Very different from the appetizer. This was more of a tomato-y sauce that reminded me a bit if shakshuka. I'm glad I tried both, but the entree wasn't that much bigger so I think that getting multiple appetizers might actually be better value.\\n\\nWe also split some saffron rice and pickles vegetables. I thought the saffron rice didn't taste very much like saffron, and the pickled veggies were VERY pickled, pretty sour honestly.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the Persian ice cream. It was my girlfriend's birthday, so I requested a candle in whatever dessert we ended up ordering and they said no problem. There was a minor miscommunication among the servers and our ice cream ended up coming out without a candle, which was so not a big deal. But within a few minutes, they brought out a slice of orange cake with a candle and apologized profusely. They ended up not charging us for either dessert. Super professional and gracious service!\\n\\nAll in all, a great spot for special occasions, date nights, or just trying Persian food if you've never had it.\", 'The food was okay. If you\\'re looking for authentic Persian food this is not it. It\\'s \"Persian\" food trying to be fancy. But isn\\'t good enough to be \"fancy.\" Won\\'t be back. It\\'s really a shame that a Persian restaurant can\\'t just serve authentic Persian food...', \"A stunning Persian culinary experience. The first time I ate here was for a friend's large scale birthday party, where we were posted up in the cellar. Despite being in the basement, the textured walls were painted a lively white with a centerpiece long communal dining table that we learned was built fully from reclaimed wood from the last renovation. The cocktails were flowing and we ordered all the main entrees. For the catch of the day, the grandmotherly owner of the restaurant, came and personally served us a piece of the fish. It made the whole experience feel incredibly homey.\\n\\nA year or so later, we came back and sat in the main restaurants upstairs. It was just as good as I remember it. Sofreh is a wonderful contribution to the NY food scene. The light was warm, ambient music set the mood, paired with attentive and personal service.\\n\\nCocktails are well priced and strong. We started off with the grilled cauliflowers (which we knew were citrusy but still a tad too stringent for me), and a beef meatball. The star of the show was the lamb shank in herb sauce that went tremendously with the herb rice and a side of tadig.\\n\\nIt was packed on a friday night, come with a res!\", \"Absolutely distraught I have just discovered this place in 2024. But to be fair it's hard to find gems like this if you aren't in the know or live in the area. Seeing as I am neither I'm glad it was better late than never. It may be a little to early to review but the overall experience was great enough to jump with in with eyes closed. What was ordered was definitely flavorful however it did leave me wanting more. More umph, more flavor, more pizzazz. I'll start with the drinks. I love both the old fashioned and mezcal cocktails (I definitely should have ordered them in reverse order so they paired better with what I ate). The cooler cocktail was intriguing but it's 100% more of a summer/warmer weather bev.\\nTo start ordered the cauliflower appetizer. It was flavorful, raw and lukewarm. The pearl onions were quite sour from the vinaigrette they were in which I didn't care for much so I left them alone after my initial taste. The tough raw slightly warm cauliflower however was exceptional and to my liking (I like my veggies the paleo way; full of vitamins and raw). Even though it was slightly hard to eat, it was accompanied by a deliciously unknown sauce to slather in (although looking at previous photos I think I'd like those sauce ratios instead of what I was served).\\nFor mains the duck, lamb and saffron rice were ordered. My dish was the duck and was perfect in every way. The duck was the most tender I have ever had. That sauce was serious crack and the addition of the pomegranate gave it great mouth feel. My partners lamb although tasty, if I had ordered it, I would have liked the sauce to be slightly thicker (it was very liquidy). The saffron rice was nice, I've had far better. However I will say the simplicity of it did accompany the meat dishes very well.\\nFor desert we had the squash halva. I was presently surprised the rose flavor was not too pungent.\\n\\nOverall get reservations asap or try your luck the second they open to see if they take walk ins (there was only one spot open when I went).\", \"the steak was honestly the best steak either of us ever had. the kitchen is unfortunately very slow no matter the day, and so is the service. pricey, but the flavors are worth it. nice atmosphere in the outdoor seating, nice inside as well if you don't mind it being a little loud. do not like that reservations have to be made 4 weeks in advance. do not try to walk in, you won't get a table.\", 'Great restaurant with great wait staff. They also have a very nice bar which is unusual for Persian restaurant. We ordered 3 apps and 6 entrees to share between 5 of us.', 'Good food. The sapphire martini was really good. So was the lamb. Wish we got the steak. The table next to us got it looked great.', 'I have tried numerous times to make a reservation for myself and a friend on various dates and at various times, well ahead of the time that I would like to go to the restaurant, and have been advised every single time that there are no tables, no matter what the day of the week or the time of the reservation.  I am convinced that the restaurant does not accept reservations for two people and my friend and I have pretty much given up on trying to eat at this restaurant.  It is also extremely frustrating that one can never talk to a live person by telephone to ask about this issue.', \"Persian restaurant with an impressive bar offering. My wife and I dined here on a weeknight. They were filled up inside but were able to seat us immediately outdoors. \\n\\nGreat bar for a Persian restaurant. They had a tap takeover from Five Boroughs; gotta love a local tap takeover. Solid cocktail list too. I was feeling wine for the evening and was happy with their selection by the glass. \\n\\nFor starters, we shared the eggplant and whey dip along with the tahini & date salad. Dip was very savory. Big caramelization flavors. Salad was pretty savory too with some nice textural contrasts. I paired this with a French rose. I was inkling for a natural wine but figured this would hit the spot.\\n\\nBetween the courses, I had white wine from Piedmont. \\n\\nFor the main course, we shared the lamb shank with the Orange zest & carrot rice. Big chunk of meat. Feel right off the bone. Believe it had a curry influenced sauce. Decided to pair this course with a red. Pretty bold on the reds with a Cote du Rhône, a Nebbiolo, a Bordeaux, and Chateau Musar. All budget friendly too at $16 or less for each. I opted for Musar for the Middle Eastern connection. \\n\\nFor dessert, I had the saffron rice pudding.\\n\\nService was polite and attentive. Drink orders were ready super quickly. The had a gender neutral restroom on the main floor which was handicap accessible. There was a second gender neutral restroom in their basement. The one on the basement had a projector playing something. Projector had USB, VGA, and AUX inputs in case you're curious.\", \"Sofreh is my new favorite restaurant. I started with the roasted cauliflower, which had a tangy tomato-chili glaze. The first bite seemed a little too spicy but then the yogurt base and the bright quick-pickled red onions and carrot shavings tempered the spice. This was a great start to the meal along with a breezy, delicious sour cherry cooler (a refreshing non-alcoholic drink).\\n\\nI could not decide between the half chicken or beef stew -- so I ordered both, figuring I'd have dinner covered for the next couple of days. The stew -- OMG. Beef slow-braised with dried Persian limes. I'd never tasted anything like this. The lime added a subtle, clear undertone that was fantastic. The chicken (again perfectly cooked) had a velvety sauce of apricot and ginger with little flecks of dried orange peel that added tiny sparks of flavor. \\n\\nI ended with the cardamom rose cake with whipped yogurt. I am a whipped cream junkie so I was thinking to myself that the yogurt would be too thick or too sour -- but I was wrong. It was like a nice cross between creme fraiche and a light frosting. And the cake was delicate and subtle and gorgeous, with the perfect crumb. The perfect ending to a perfect meal.\\n\\nFinally, I appreciated the service and attention I received. When I dine alone, I sometimes feel invisible -- like the staff sees a woman dining alone as less important. At Sofreh, the staff was attentive and friendly and part of the fun of eating here. Can't wait to return.\", \"Came here for dinner before the nets game. Was expecting something unique and the dishes met my expectations. The steak was very different and delicious with a great sear and good fat ratio. I normally do not eat lamb because of how gamey it can be but this lamb shank was amazing. It was flavorful, tender, and not gamey at all. My fiance and I loved the eggplant dip with bread (the garlic chips and onion were so good!). The dessert was good but nothing that was wow factor. I don't think it's necessary to get the rice but the carbs did help with balancing some of the stronger flavors in the meat. Great service too. Ava was lovely\", \"Five stars for the dinner I had while I was there. \\nWas entertaining out of towners and they loved it. Still talking about it days later. \\n\\nBut the absolute fury I was consumed with when I got home after dinner only to realize the lamb shank I maybe ate 1/3 of and then asked to be packed up to go? THEY DIDNT PACK UP THE BONE.\\n\\nI grew up in a middle eastern household, we would argue over who got the marrow filled bones. A DELICACY. And this bone was gloriously marrow filled and I was not about to sit in this fancy spot shoving a fork in it and banging it around, or even worse just fully trying to suction the marrow out in public because I'm a classy lady.... I asked for it to be packed up FOR A REASON. It was gonna meet its demise in the lovely privacy of my own home. \\n\\nOur table dropped over $300 and I didn't even get to enjoy the bite I was looking forward to the most!! So note to the servers if someone asks for something to go DONT THROW ANY OF IT AWAY. If it feels silly at least take a second to ask the customer if they want it. If it was a container issue they could have wrapped it in plastic wrap or something. ANYTHING. I'm still mad about it days later.\", \"Really delicious food! This is the first time I've had Persian food, so my expectations are now set high.\\n\\nWe started off with a few cocktails, which I have to say, were not my favorite. I ordered the gin cucumber cocktail, but it basically just tasted like gin. While that speaks to their generous pouring, I value taste over strength in my cocktails.\\n\\nFor food, we ordered the kofteh (meatball dish), Persian herb & noodle stew, saffron rice, and half chicken. The kofteh was amazing. The meatballs were absolutely perfect, just bursting with flavor. The tomato broth and yogurt the meatballs were bathed in added so much dimension. I would 100% recommend this appetizer. The herb & noodle stew was good, but not my favorite. I thought it tasted a bit thin, especially after experiencing the kofteh. The half chicken was delicious. The meat was so tender, so juicy, so flavorful. Paired with the saffron rice, this entree was a dream. Would definitely recommend.\\n\\nFor dessert, we treated ourselves to the cardamom rose cake. It was unlike anything I've ever had! The cake itself was so soft and fluffy, and the orange marmalade paired so well with the sweetness of the cake. It was also topped with whipped yogurt, which I didn't personally like, but you can also eat around it.\\n\\nOverall, delicious food! I will definitely be back for more kofteh.\", \"TLDR: great ambiance, amazing flavorful food and a must visit in the area! \\n\\nSETTING; friend got a res for 6 people at 8pm on a Friday night. We sat outdoors though it was a bit chilly. They have beautiful floral decorations and hanging lights making it a cozy outdoor backyard. The indoors looked tightly packed with seat taken. Perfect for bigger groups (saw some of those) as well as date night, family, friends, etc.\\n\\nFOOD: we ordered so. Much. Food... and we were able to finish a lot of it. Everything was very tasty and flavorful and each recommendation by our server was better than the last. \\n\\nThe standouts for me were: the chicken (and I don't love chicken but the way they prepared this was so tasty and different), the lamb shank of course (fell off the bone and couldn't have been more tender), the mushrooms (idk what they put in it but crack). I will say every single thing was delicious so I don't think you can go wrong. Go crazy!!\\n\\nSERVICE: service was excellent. Our server was always there to help and advise and her recommendations were great!! \\n\\nVERDICT: such a great beautiful place for delicious flavorful food. Highly recommend!\", 'SOFREH-KIN\\' DELICIOUS!!! Came in with a big group on a weeknight and ordered about half the menu. If you don\\'t have a reservation, they take the first five people in for bar seating each night and the remaining are waitlisted, which is about a 2 hour wait.\\n\\nThe stars of the \"sofreh\" were the ribeye, halibut -- fish of the day, mushroom, cauliflower--both roasted and cauli-steak, medjool date rice, tahini date salad and the tahdig was so unique with a buttery crusted top and extra crispy texture. The plates come out mostly tapas style/portion size and they will recommend ordering many, many plates for sharing. You really can\\'t go wrong with anything, we loved everything we had. Flavors are phenomenal, ambience is lovely and quaint, they also have a quiet dining room downstairs. Also, definitely get the ice cream for dessert, it is do die for! We had no expectations but this was truly one of the best meals I\\'ve had in NYC!', \"Sofreh is almost an impossible table at the moment, and I would not risk a walk-in, but I played the Resy notification game and got a table outside just before the weather turned freezing. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I started with the Sekanjabin Martini and Anar cocktail, then tried:\\n\\n+ Grilled cabbage\\n+ Roasted butternut squash\\n+ Tahini and date salad\\n+ Lamb shank\\n+ Smoked eggplant \\n+ Saffron rice \\n+ Cardamom rose cake\\n\\nThe cabbage was my absolute favorite thing - definitely a sleeper hit. The lamb shank is also a must (you'll see at least one on every table for good reason). Also loved the butternut squash. Need to come back ASAP!\", 'I brought my friends here from CA and we were getting hangry because the food took forever. The eggplant dip was delicious with the bread. The mushroom appetizer was flavorful but too small. The lamb shank was appetizing and the meat fell off the bone. Overall, I made the reservation awhile ago and I think trying this place once is good enough.', 'Well, wanted to treat my friend for dinner & took about 45 mins subway ride to go to this place! Delicious food..\\n\\nWe ordered 1. Eggplant from appetizers & 2. Lamb & 3. Cauliflower stake for entrees..For dessert we ordered: 4. Rose cake & 5. Rice pudding...\\n\\nI wish the cauliflower stake was a bit more cooked..& I wish they consider one other vegan/vegetarian dish for entrees (the current eggplant one is more suitable as an appetizer).. The cake was a bit dry...\\n\\nBut overall, very good food & experience!', \"This was an unfortunate, unenjoyable meal. I've wanted to visit Sofreh as Iranian friends have vouched for the authenticity and quality of food. We deliberately made reservations to come take out of town friends but we were left with a rather unpleasant visit. \\n\\nFirstly, much to our own fault and over excitement from seeing friends for the first time in awhile, we had all indulged in continuous snacking & catching up all day. By the time we made it to our dinner reservation, we wanted a lighter dinner. We had communicated this to our server and she was visibly unhappy that the crowd she had wasn't going to order in abundance. Our grp unanimously felt a hostile pressure to order more more more. Our experience was uncomfortable to say the least, which begs the question of how staff are incentivized at this establishment.  \\n\\nAs for the actual food quality, it was quite uneven. \\n\\nFor starters we shared the eggplant & whey dip, grilled cabbage with pomegranate seeds, and their tahini & date salad. These were the best part of the meal and were seasoned well. We also ordered the roasted cauliflowers and would advise to skip as it didn't have quite the same flavor distinction as the other dishes. \\n\\nBy 6:30 the restaurant had ran out of their special tahdig so we resorted to their standard saffron and herb rice. These were OK at best and were rather small in portions. \\n\\nFor the mains we resorted dried lime & herb stew. While the sauce was ok the braised beef itself was dry and unseasoned. Out of pressure to order we added another eggplant dish, which thankfully was light enough in order to not overstuff the grp. \\n\\n\\nOther things to note:\\n\\nThe restaurant had outdoor seating and on a surprisingly warm November night we were surprised we couldn't sit outside. Perhaps they are understaffed and that was an unfortunate miss as far as ambiance.\\n\\nThe cocktails were ok. Fairly priced for the area and delish albeit not memorable. \\n\\nThe only part of the service we appreciated was the pacing. The courses came out slowly which allowed us to digest and make room for the courses.\\n\\nLast couple of things: loved the bathroom wallpaper that showcases a less conservative Persia & the chef's on the house halva that was intended to raise awareness of current issues in Iran.\", \"Food: absolutely amazing, mouth watering, taste buds bursting flavors. Every meal was to die for. The duck confit was juicy and tender, rating at one of the best cooked duck I've had. The dessert, saffron ice cream, is still running through my mind very day. I simply loved it. \\n\\nService: The waiters were warm and very informative. The lag time between the appetizers and dinner was astronomical. I started to look up other food places in fear it wouldn't come out. The owner did come out and apologize for the long wait, as well.\", 'A great addition to the Prospect Heights restaurant scene.  This place really deserves 3.7 stars but I rounded up.  A unique menu with eclectic flavors, set in a simple yet elegant atmosphere, where the food is the highlight.  I enjoyed the simple decour and the attentive staff, and despite the table ahead of us staying a half hour over there reservation, the comped appetizer more than made up for it.  \\n\\nThe meal started off with a date salad with a tahini, honey and chili oil dressing.  The only hint of capsicum of the meal, this is a must order.  The contrast of sweet dates and spicy dressing was refreshing.  The sesame seeds added a great textural element.\\n\\nNext served was the kofteh, which is a flavorful beef meatball with a saffron yogurt sauce.  The meatball was tender and flavorful, but the sauce was underwhelming.  \\n\\nMy least favorite dish was a confusing Herb and Noodle Stew.  The soggy noodles and lentils, overwhelmed the fried onions, garlic and mint which got lost in the sauce (stew).  I would recommend not exploring this option.\\n\\nThe mains were both perfectly cooked and tender.  The lamb shank with fava beans fell right off the bone into a decadent turmeric and onion broth.  Just a fatty meat in a salty broth that hit all the right notes.\\n\\nThe Duck Fesenjan, cooked 2 ways, was beautiful.  A roast leg of duck paired with pomegranates and a beautifully seared duck breast in rich walnut sauce.  The thought of this dish makes my mouth water.  A fantastic way to end the meal, and a must order.', \"This is more of an upscale restaurant  aesthics inside remind me a fancy cave like atmosphere. Absolutely love. \\n\\nService is five star, hostess's and servers alike.\\n\\nThe food is very tasty. Eggplant dip and yogurt dip for apps fresh. I got the lamb shank which was fall off the bone good. The chicken with pomegranate was my fave dish.  Place is on the more expensive side so this would be a place for a special occasion.\", \"Delicious! This is unlike anything I've eaten before!  The flavors are built with quality ingredients along with a beautiful combination of herbs and spices.  Every dishes flavor profile was unique and flavorful.  \\nWe ordered five apps and two entrees.  We drank Hendricks gin martinis which were amazing.  \\nWe didn't have reservations but waited outside on a Saturday night at 5:15 for a table.  At 5:15 we snagged the one table that was not already reserved.  At 6:00 the place was packed and with good reason.  This place is not a secret.   The owner/chef came around to check on us twice and even brought over an extra drink for the four of us at our table.\", \"I might've came with a bit too high of expectations since I love Persian food. \\n\\nThe starters didn't blow us away, we got the eggplant dip which is usually my favorite this one was missing the Smokey flavor. The bread was a bit dry, and the date and tahini salad that was highly recommended which cost $16 was nothing to rave about.\\nThe herb rice was good, Iranians always have the best rice but the lamb didn't have enough sauce, and it was more on the dry side. \\nLastly, the star of the show was the Persian ice-cream! Highly recommend it. However the rose cardamom case was dry and the frosting on top was extremely weirdly sour which threw us off.\\nOur waiter was amazing but the hostess was awful, she gave us attitude and forgot to give us menus as she sat us right a front of her eyes..had to ask the waiter to get us menus after 10 minutes of seating.

Every meal had a burst of flavor - spices were not skimped on here.  \\n\\nThe server was very friendly and kind.  He made you feel like you were in an Auntie's kitchen. \\n\\nWe will return to try other dishes.  Highly recommend!\", \"Friendly staff but they keep \\nforgetting utensil other than \\n\\nPlace is alright \\nFood taste great \\nAround $62 without tax \\nFood presentation don't good ..\", \"It pains me to give this restaurant 3 stars since it's a small mom and pop joint, but all the food felt extra oily, they got our order wrong, and we all thought the service could be improved.\\n\\nI needed to make a relatively last minute reservation for Mother's Day lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised that LoveMama had plenty of slots available just a couple days beforehand.\\n\\nWhen my party of 4 arrived on Sunday at 11:30, I was surprised to see the whole restaurant was empty. We were the first party seated. It gradually filled up, but it definitely wasn't nearly as busy as I thought it'd be for a restaurant in this location with so many reviews on Yelp.\\n\\nMaybe it's because we came on a rainy day, but most of the restaurant felt very dim even at 11:30 am. We sat at the table closest to the window for maximum light. \\n\\nThey offer a good selection of Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian appetizers and entrees at a very affordable price point. I was particularly impressed by their $12 weekday lunch combo, which comes with one appetizer + entree.\\n\\nI shared with one other friend and the rest got their own food. We shared:\\n\\nRoti canai planta ($7) - this is the first time I didn't love roti canai at a restaurant. The roti just felt extra oily and the lentil dip wasn't that tasty\\n\\nRendang nasi lemak with chicken ($15) - this is their most popular dish, so I knew we had to try it. The owner took our order and recommended we get it with chicken instead of beef, which is the usual meat. The chicken came with a lot of flavor, but we could barely taste the coconut in the coconut rice, and there wasn't nearly enough rice to go with the amount of chicken provided\\n\\nChar kwa teow with beef (but not sure if we got pad see eew instead??) - we asked for this with beef and not spicy, and the first time we got the dish, it came with chili flakes all over it and had chicken. I would've let the chicken slide, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and one bite of the dish had my mouth burning, so we let the owner know and he quickly came back with a non-spicy beef noodle dish. All's well that ends well, right....\\n\\nHOWEVER, when we checked the bill at the end of the meal, we realized he entered Pad See Eew into their ordering system, so I'm pretty sure we got pad see eew rather than char kwa teow. Very disappointed that they got the order wrong. No wonder the noodles were on the sweeter side; I was very confused by the sweetness.\\n\\nMy two other friends ordered the pad thai and both enjoyed their noodles. I think that's the dish to get here.\", 'This was by far the best meal I had in New York.! My friends and I had the best time Peter, the cook chef Owner, and the man you see here in the photo made us feel just like family! The place is small, and has some character that Peter and his wife put together . However, I must emphasize the food was soooo delicious and everything Peter served us was full of flavor, but what I keep wanting is the mango sticky rice that was so good.', \"Fast food type Asian foods, Vietnamese, Malaysia, Indonesian.

We ordered the red curry and the pad kee mao (both vegetarian), was really surprised that both items came out in plastic containers! Our entrees were served in togo containers and styrofoam plates. This is not what I was expecting. The food was decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Was honestly shocked for the prices we paid that we got plastic/styrofoam plates with no explanation. Going to give this spot a 2 for service but rounding to 3 as the food was decent. Next time will be checking out Soothr.', 'Amazing food, sweetest owners ever!! Prepared our food quickly :)) Cozy space for anyone who wants a quick bite or a nice, family run sit down restaurant.', \"No frills, no nonsense. Superior authentic Thai/Vietnamese/Malaysian food. Yesterday was sibling day, and we always venture out to new and beloved spots. After our massages, we were famished, and my sister was craving Thai while I was craving Vietnamese.  This popped up in a subcategory on the Yelp search. Immediately, it grabbed my attention because, could this be? Exactly what I'm searching for? Yes. Yes, it was. A mash up of all things good, and we got to trekking. Small spot, fast service. Attentive. \\n\\nDecor was on the lower end, but to me, this signals that the food can hold its own. So, I was excited. 2 Thai iced teas, wings, Thai Tom yum soup, curry coconut soup, Uncle Phats dumplings, and a honey porkchop. The three of us simultaneously agreed the honey porkchop was the best thing on the table and of course it was mine and they'd wished they'd went with my pick lol But, I'm glad they didn't. We picked at each other's dishes. The soups were so authentic and fresh that it was mind-blowing. Served in a simple understated take out container. We were pleasantly surprised at the complexity of flavors. \\n\\nThe table favorite was the honey porkchop. Served with rice and palette cleansing veggies. Grilled to perfection,  charred beautifully. Marinated somewhere between Vietnamese and Malaysian style. Absolutely delicious. Uncle Phats dumplings came in a peanut sauce that elevated it to another level. You can tell that whatever comes out of the kitchen isn't coming from a frozen bag. It is very fresh, and if it is frozen, they've perfected their techniques on how to appear freshly made. The dumplings itself were made so that you can taste the meat, the green onion, garlic, and slight ginger. \\nThe wings were perfectly cooked and sauced to perfection in a general tso type of sauce. \\n\\nThe service was good. Nothing ostentatious or annoying. We shared plates, but nobody tripped and no added fee either. The entire meal came out to roughly $63. Before leaving, we met the owner who popped out and asked if we liked everything, and we quickly sung their praises in unison. My sibling are not easy to impress. We come from a land of food diversity and we often know what can be proclaimed as authentic and who's faking it. There is no faking here. This is all the way true to the game. We will definitely be back to try other things. Loved everything we got. Much love to the owners.\", \"Three cuisines under one cozy, humble roof. I've never had Malaysian food, and Thai and Vietnamese is some of my favorite. Love Mama does each one very well. I had a spicy shrimp soup that was probably the first legit spicy thing I've had in NYC. My friend enjoyed his pho ga, and we shared some chicken wings that were perfectly crispy and delicious.

It's cheap but portions are small and like a cafeteria lunch scooped onto a plastic plate.

Honestly if they had more generous portion, I'd be more forgiving as it would fit nicely into a good food, good value hole in the wall type place. But nope, poor value, decent food, which does not make up for the service and vibe and experience, a I'd probably have to order 2-3 plates to get full. So really double the menu prices to get a normal plate size. \\n\\nI think the place is good but not AMAZING as you'd expect for over 6000 reviews 4.5 stars in NYC.

The best part was that the soft eggplant pieces were coated in a semi-firm sugary shell that made for such great contrast.

Service was great but I'm not sure if I would come back again for the food.\", \"We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday, and this place was just perfect! First off, the location is absolutely beautiful--ideal for big groups or a special date night. We visited during the day on a weekday, and the atmosphere was so nice and relaxed. I can only imagine how stunning this place must be at night with all the lights!\\n\\nThe food was fantastic, and the staff really went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. If you're traveling with a stroller, no worries--the bathrooms and the layout provide plenty of space, making it super convenient.\\n\\nHighly recommend this spot for a special occasion or just a lovely night out!\", \"I've been to antidote twice now and i can truly say I'm an absolute fan.\\n\\nThe ambience here is really nice. It's a perfect place for a date. A place to take a client. Your mother, whoever. It doesn't really matter. It all works.\\n\\nYou guys. The food here is so good. I feel like I've had it all. \\n\\nAbsolute musts:\\n\\nThe cucumbers\\n\\nYes, i said cucumbers. I am still trying to figure out how they slice them so nearly like that. And tossed in scallion & ginger sauce with some sesame oil. Wow. I would go just for three, honestly.\\n\\nSpicy cabbage \\n\\nNormally, i do not like spicy but this is the next must. If you come here and don't get this you didn't do yourself a proper visit. It's simple- cabbage, chili and mixed vegetable but so so so so delicious.\\n\\nScallion pancake\\n\\nJust because \\n\\nHere some others to get:\\n\\nFei- hong fries \\nWonton in chili sauce\\nPork dumplings in chili sauce \\nChicken soup dumplings\\n\\nThis place is a treasure trove of good food. Eat up and enjoy.\", \"Antidote was absolutely amazing! I probably had Chinese food about 5 times while I was staying in the area. I'm a huge fan of kung pao chicken and this one was definitely my favorite in the area. The service was great and they also have a really great happy hour. It's also super cute and spacious inside.\", 'Everything was so delicious. The fries were amazing. The king pao shrimp was amazing and the wontons were amazing.', 'Deeeeelicious Chinese food \\nNot the stuff from the Chinese spot on the corner ! Clean oil fresh seasoning and ingredients \\nThe drinks were top notch also \\nLoved the swiveling cup \\nWill definitely be back \\n\\nS/b pork belly had too much fat there so that caused the deduction of 1 star', \"I'd go back!!\\n\\nFirst, service was really good. Everything came really quickly. We were late for our reservation and they still saved us a table, which I really appreciated! \\n\\nAlso, the food was great! They had the best scallion pancakes I've ever had. They also had the best pork belly I've ever had. The tea smoked duck was fine, but it wasn't as good as the pork. \\n\\nI liked the ambiance in general, but the one thing that could be better would be having more bathrooms (there was a line).\", \"I've heard of antidote being one of the best from friends and Instagram, and it did not disappoint. Came for lunch, and you know it's a good sign when both young people AND families are at this place. It means it has hype, but it's also good enough for parents to enjoy and value too. It didn't look like what I expected! It had a cozy vibe and super family friendly. There's even a large table for bigger groups. \\n\\nEverything we ordered was very good. The pork trotters were a newer item, and balanced the fatty pork with the cilantro, cumin, and nuts. The chicken was standard, and maybe a bit inconsistent in size. The tomato beef soup was very flavorful and missed from my common order at Szechuan mountain house. The crab tofu is a must order, and pairs perfectly with a bowl of rice.\\n\\nPricing is very reasonable and cocktails are not bad too! I'll definitely be back.\", \"Had a really satisfying meal. The scallion pancake & the cucumbers were my favorite. The slice fish and mapo tofu were both good but felt pretty comparable to what I've had at other restaurants.\\n\\nIt looks pretty cool inside. Gave me fancy cave vibes.\", \"We visited this restaurant last night, a Saturday evening. Before heading out, we called and were informed that the wait time for a table for three would be 30-45 minutes. That seemed reasonable, so we decided to go. Upon arrival, I added our name to the waitlist for a table for two adults and a two-year-old. The front desk then told us it would take about an hour. Again, we were okay with the wait.\\n\\nIt was a particularly cold and windy night, so we went to a nearby café and strolled around the neighborhood while waiting for a text notification that never came. After an hour and a half, we returned to the restaurant, only to be told that it would take even longer to get a table. To make matters worse, they offered us a tiny table for two near the door, where people constantly passed by, and the cold wind made the spot unbearable.\\n\\nI was shocked by the lack of empathy from the front desk staff, especially the woman in charge. Despite seeing us with a small, cold, and crying child, she made no effort to accommodate or assist us. The poor planning and inaccurate wait-time estimates demonstrated by this restaurant are unacceptable, especially in a city like NYC. We've dined at many Szechuan restaurants in the city, all of which have been busy with long lines. However, their wait-time estimates have always been accurate, and we've often been seated earlier than expected. Unfortunately, this was not the case here.\\n\\nIf you're considering visiting, particularly if you're traveling from outside Williamsburg, be aware that it may not be worth it. Other reviews even mention issues with honoring reservations, which seems to be a pattern. There are far better options in the city, such as Uluh, Mountain House, Chef Tan, Blue Willow, and Café China. That night, we ended up getting takeout from Mountain House instead--and it was an excellent choice. I've included a photo of it here.\\n\\nWill I return to this restaurant? Maybe someday, but certainly not in the near future. This experience ruined our evening and left a bitter impression that will take time to fade. Until then, this restaurant earns its one-star rating for poor planning and customer service.\", \"Feel like they can do something about the tables for 2. They spaced them so close together that you're essentially right next to the other tables, listening to their conversations as well, it was uncomfortable. There was barely enough space to walk between the tables to sit. Restaurant had plenty of space too so they could definitely have moved 2 tables so we weren't all sitting on top of each other.\\n\\nGot a cocktail, Slow Ride. Disappointing drink, just a giant ice cube, didn't taste much else in the drink. \\n\\nFor food, we had the leshan chicken which is a cold dish. It was spicy and went well with white rice. Tea smoked duck was also good.\", 'Authentic and delicious chinese spot located in Brooklyn! As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a beautiful space that was very modern and complimented with plants. \\n\\nThe food was incredible, my favorite was the salted egg yolk and crab tofu which I would highly recommend! Also loved the chili fish and my only complaint was that the cucumber salad was a little salty but the flavors were still phenomenal. \\n\\nThey also have a larger table off the to the side making it the perfect place to host a birthday dinner!', \"One of my favorite Szechuan restaurants! I keep coming back here because of the ambience and selection of food. The menu is huge, so you never have to eat the same thing twice. But I do because it's just that good. My favorites are the crab tofu, fei-hong spicy prawn, green beans, and the golden fish filet. I didn't think veggies could be so good, but their green beans are chef's kiss. I also really like their cocktails, which are all very unique but tasty. Very spacious restaurant as well so perfect for a date night or a group dinner.\", \"Visited here for a friend's birthday and the ambiance and aesthetic were AMAZING! We went on a Wednesday, which is when they have live jazz. Very nice. The food was very fresh and savory and the wait staff were very punctual. \\n\\nNot pictured: shrimp dumplings, scallion pancakes, and pan fried pork dumplings \\n\\nEverything was delicious! Can't wait to go back!\", \"I got a reservation here for a Saturday afternoon lunch while a friend from out of town was visiting. It is so bright with natural light with a really cool patio seating feeling, though you're inside. Service was decent and there were a variety of people eating there.\\n\\nFor all te hype I heard around it, I expected it to be much better than it was. We went to Spicy Moon the day before. Without the direct comparison, we probably would've loved Antidote but having had more flavorful Szechuan the day before, it definitely knocked some points. \\n\\nI would order their string beans and cumin lamb again in a heartbeat but next time I'll probably skip the pig ears and dan dan noodles.\", \"Flavorful food and great cocktails in a trendy part of Brooklyn (Williamsburg). Made a reservation for a bigger party and were seated promptly. \\n\\nOrdered a bit of everything: \\n- 2 orders of: wontons in chili oil, scallion pancake, sautéed string beans, Sichuan chili chicken\\n- 1 order of: crab tofu, mapo tofu, fish in chili oil, dongpo pork, beef tripe in chili oil, sesame cold noodles, and eggplant in garlic sauce.\\n\\nTo start off, a couple of us enjoyed some of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages: Suntory Story, Daolug, Chill Out, Be Passion, and Strawberry Puree Mocktail. Drinks were well-mixed and on the sweet side, you couldn't taste the alcohol (which is a delight but also quite dangerous). \\n\\nFor the apps, all were enjoyable and flavorful. Our party thoroughly enjoyed the wontons in chili oil, scallion pancake, and eggplant in garlic sauce most. The cold noodles, string beans, and beef tripe in chili oil were average and nothing too remarkable.\\n\\nFor mains, all were a mixed review. The Sichuan fried chicken was all fry and no flavor or heat, which was to our dismay. The crab tofu was extremely crabby and the flavor of salted egg yolk was strong - if you are not a fan of either, you will not enjoy this dish. Mapo tofu was nothing special. Fish in chili oil was slightly bland - the fish texture was also a bit too soft, which some may not enjoy. The dongpo pork was flavorful and tender, however very fatty (made up majority of the meat). \\n\\nAs for desserts, we got both of their offerings: salted egg yolk bun and rice cakes with a brown sugar syrup. The egg yolk bun is nothing special - the classic dim sum sweet treat. The toasted rice cakes with soybean powder and brown sugar syrup was the perfect asian dessert - sweet but not too sweet. Thank you so much to the manager/staff for the two desserts - they surprised us with it being on the house after we told them it was for a birthday! \\n\\nOverall, some dishes were a hit and some were a miss. However, it is still worth coming and dining in at this Restaurant. Some dishes were hits and some could've been better. Definitely don't miss out on their cocktails. \\n\\nThank you so much to the staff for making it an enjoyable and smooth experience - for being patient with us and celebrating a birthday with us!\", 'Decor and ambiance is A+ but the restaurant was a bit chilly. A couple of the other customers and I were still wearing our jackets inside the restuarant.\\n\\nHowever, the food is just like any other average Szechuan food out there. \\n\\nStarted the meal off with the \"Scallion Pancake\" which was good, the sauce was sweet and the pancakes were crispy. Ordered the \"Sui Mai with Tea Smoked Duck\" which was pretty salty, wasn\\'t worth the price to be honest. \\n\\nSautéed string beans was also good but too salty. The Dandan noodle was fresh and good. The Dongpo pork and crab fried rice was actually my favorite but it was also just... average in my opinion. However the price for the entire meal was extremely fair. If you want good asian food around Brooklyn, Antidote is worth going to due to it\\'s price and it definitely does reflect what Szechuan food is supposed to taste like.', \"I've been here twice and both times have been great!! Very delicious Chinese food with a great ambiance. Came here on a Wednesday for dinner and there was live music playing. We got the spicy soup dumplings, wontons in chili oil, kung pao chicken and fried rice with mustard greens. My favorite was the wontons in chili oil but all of them were great! Looking forward to coming back and trying new things\", \"2.5/5 \\nFinally got the chance to try antidote and I wasn't particularly wowed by it tbh. \\n\\nPros - very extensive menu with a ton of options! Really liked the shrimp dish because the shrimp was large, juicy, and had a ton of flavor. Also liked the baiju cocktail! It had a lot of different flavor profiles that blended together in a good way. Portion sizes were also large! Also the interior design was very cute and cozy. \\n\\nCons - I think they went for presentation over flavor a lot of the time. For example, the blossom fish was DROWNED in sauce - yes it looked cool but it felt unnecessary and just made it overly saucy. The Dan Dan noodles had a great flavor but were kind of cold when they came out. There wasn't enough crab in the crab tofu and it was a little overly egg yolky for me.\", \"On a Friday evening, I walked in and tried to put my name down for a table for two but all the tables were supposedly booked for the entirety of the night. Walk ins were only allowed at the bar area. When I returned an hour later, we had to put our names down for a 30-40 minute wait at the bar. By 7/8pm, the restaurant was incredibly busy and jammed packed. \\n\\nThe ambience of the place is definitely phenomenal with the lighting and decor. There's also jazz music on Wednesday nights. Once we were seated, the servers were all pretty nice as well. \\n\\nIn terms of the food, we got garlic peashoots, twice cooked pork, and crab tofu. It is worth noting that rice does not come with the dishes and are $2 each. My personal favorite was the twice cooked pork but everything was pretty good. I liked the flavors of everything but will admit the pork was a bit oily and the peashoots could've used slightly more flavor. While the prices were a bit on the high end, the portions were quite generous and everything we ordered was more than enough for two people.\", \"Antidote is in a beautiful space right off Wythe in Williamsburg, we had a group dinner there last week and absolutely loved it.  When we arrived they told us we had 90 minutes for a table of 6 with a reservation, which seemed a  little rushed, but the food and drinks came out so efficiently it didn't end up being a rush at all.\\n\\nThe food was fantastic, really well executed sichuan specialties.  Their Dan Dan, Mapo Tofu, Chongqing Chicken and Cumin lamb all were executed about as well as you can get.  We also got soup dumplings out of curiosity at a Sichuan restaurant, and they were fine but nothing special.  The big surprise was our curiosity got the best of us on their special of the night (mango chicken) which was essentially a dressed up Sweet & Sour Chicken (yes there's some shame ordering it at a restaurant like this, but also hope they'd elevate it).  It paired really well with the Sichuan dishes!  It was much better than the normal American-Chinese rendition, and the light sweetness helped cut the salt and heat of all the wonderful Sichuan dishes.\\n\\nLastly, we drank a lot of cocktails, and they were all very good.  I never remember the name of cocktails when they're specialist, but everyone enjoyed every one they had.\", \"Crab tofu was my favorite - it was savory and rich, and I couldn't stop eating it. Eggplant was pretty good too, and dong po pork was super soft. Xiaolongbao was pretty standard. The ambiance is great for dates and hangouts because it's nice and spacious.\", \"Finally got to check out Antidote over the weekend and I was quite excited. I love beautifully decorated restaurant that is thought out with every details but yet looking effortless. Let's just say every angle was instagrammable and almost has an artistic minimalistic vibe. \\n\\nWe arrived around 2pm on a Sunday without reservation and luckily they were able to seat us right away. Perhaps we were lucky or just came at the right timing but I like to believe it was both. As for their seats, they were very comfortable and with the hanging plants and sunroof, the restaurant felt perfect. \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive and they gave us enough time to decide on our choosing which was nice considering most chinese restaurant move at a very pace. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering their fish soup, fried fish encrusted in salted egg yolk and their dan dan noodles. Flavor wise, it was on point but the crazy amount of salt was just way too much and kinda ruin the flavor itself. \\n\\nI found myself drinking water constantly and asking for refills. If the chef wasn't so heavy handed with the sodium, they would have received the extra star. Food wise, they get 3 stars but decor wise they definitely deserve their 5 start which average them out to 4 star total.\", 'I stumbled upon this hidden gem while waiting for a brunch table nearby and was delighted to discover it. Unaware it was in the area, I decided to pop in for a drink at the bar.\\n\\nThe decor is meticulously curated, with attention paid to every small detail. From the moment my glass of water was poured, I was captivated by the unique glassware used to serve the drinks. The cocktails were delicious and expertly crafted. Although my visit was brief, this place is now on my list to circle back for dinner.', \"Ambience for an intimate dinner or date - food is just okay. Similar to Birds of a Feather or Mr. Bar with a nicer vibes. \\n\\nFood: average - nothing stood out, nothing you can't get at any other Szechuan restaurant - 3/5\\n- Dan Dan noodles\\n- Pork dumplings in chile oil \\n- Tea smoked duck\\n- Dongpo pork \\n\\nDrink: 4/5 - their Be Passion drink is easy to drink, cute with a sprig of lavender on top,\", \"I enjoyed this place. It was very packed and loud so we had to yell our questions but the waiter was so kind and patient. I enjoyed the eggplant dish my cousin ordered more than the beef dish I chose. Eggplant was delicious. The beef had a numbing effect (possibly cooked with peppercorns). If I knew that I wouldn't have ordered it. Aside from the numbing effect it had an amazing flavor! I will be back to try other things! The scallion pancakes were the highlight for me.\", \"I truly loved my dining experience at Antidote. Came here last night- we were a group of 5. The restaurant is very nice and the waiters were friendly and helpful. We ordered the spicy pork soup dumplings, chicken dumplings, spicy cold noodles, beef, fried chicken (wasn't a fan), crab fried rice, shrimp was AMAZING and so was the eggplant in garlic sauce. Literally drooling thinking about it. I had a spicy margarita- I didn't love it. It didn't have enough of a kick and not strong enough. However the food was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to return!\", \"Came here with a group of friends and we had a pretty great experience overall! Staff and service were excellent & the ambiance is perfection. It's such a vibe and spacious. Love it. \\n\\nAs for food, majority were good! Here's what we got: \\n\\n- Numbing cubes (5/5): The table's favorite dish! The rib eye cubes were cooked perfectly & tender. So much great flavor. Loved. \\n- Duck fried rice (4.5/5): Fried really well and loved the Duck in there. Great flavor & yummy. \\n- String Beans (4.5/5): Can't go wrong but it had a lot of great flavor & depth. \\n- Eggplants with Garlic (4/5): Classic Chinese dish made well! Nothing crazy, but tased good.  \\n- Sichuan chili fried chicken (3/5): Ok so flavor wise it's a 4/5 however...omg..for $22..I think you can afford to put a little bit more chicken. It felt like we were fishing for scraps and small little pieces of chicken with a mountain full of pepper. \\n- Golden fish filet (2.5/5): It was SO dry, maybe overcooked, and not enough fish. It tasted like majority some kind of batter of the salted egg yolk then a VERY thin fish. It did not feel like I was eating fish lol. Huge miss on this one. \\n\\nOverall though..we had a great experience & the drinks were good! It's a great place to go with friends or a date. I'd still go back but maybe not get the dishes that were a bit disappointing.\", \"Wow what a spot. This place was like being in singapore. \\n\\nFirst of all this is a cool trendy place in hip Williamsburg. We actually went by the stop twice because it looked like a great bar but not C a place for down home food-from-my-mom.\\n\\nInstead this place is both. The food is wonderful and the drinks are great too. Some one who is an actually from singapore and she said it was great. Being Asian, I couldn't wait to try it!\\n\\nThe singapore crab rice is great as was promised but the other dishes were excellent. The curry was wonderful and I just loved the drinks as well. \\n\\nThe mapu tofu was nice and spicy. Also the fried rice cakes were wonderful. We really like even the simple dishes like the eggplant. It's hard to go wrong here. \\n\\nIt is a great staff as well. Just remember it's hard to get a reservation but definitely worth it!\", \"Came here with a reservation on a Tuesday.

Packed with flavor and spicy in the best possible way!\\nOverall, this is definitely a fantastic option if you're craving quality Sichuan food!\", 'I liked it but it was very crowded on a weekday. Had to make a RSVP to get a seat at the bar. Food was good. It was my first time having crab tofu which I enjoyed. Drink had a lot of foam on top.

It also took us a while to get their attention so we could ask for the check which was a bit annoying.\", \"I was honestly expecting a half decent pho based on the reviews. The hubs said they're more known for other menu items, but since it was my first try, I always get the combo or house pho to judge if I'd return.

I definitely put a lot of hoisin and sriracha sauce. Also, there were only two pieces of beef which didn't seem like much for a $17 bowl of pho. Service was meh. The server barely acknowledged us and didn't seem to want to serve us. It was okay overall but I probably would not come back since there's better food options in DUMBO.\", 'The chefs at Em Vietnamese Bistro have once again outdone themselves. The garlic butter clams are still just as delicious as the first few times we had them, which demonstrates consistency in terms of the high quality of the ingredients, as well as the cooking skills of the chefs. The calamari and its avocado sauce is unbelievably delicious! I can say for certain that the avocado sauce is by far the best sauce I ever had, so please do yourself a favor and get this! The fried rice was extremely flavorful as well, with a strong sense of \"Wok Hei,\" which translates to the Breath of the Wok, which you only get if the chef cooks the dish perfectly with a large fire! The fried rice paired perfectly with the pork belly, which is sweet, saucy, and meaty, which creates a wonderful symphony of flavors! The restaurant itself is spacious and the service is exemplary; Kenny and the other waitress took amazing care of us and made sure that my family, especially the children, were safe and comfortable! \\n\\nOverall we had another amazing dining experience and we can\\'t wait to go back with our friends! Please give them a try and I promise you won\\'t regret it! \\n\\nThank you for reading and best of luck! (:', \"Em Vietnamese Bistro is a fairly new restaurant in the Dumbo neighborhood. After it's opening, I've heard numerous recommendations to try it out because the food there is so good. It took me about a year or so to finally try this place out after all the raves. What really deter me away are the prices, which reflects the lack of affordability of this neighborhood in general. They have another location in Bensonhurst Brooklyn, where the prices are cheaper. \\n\\nI got the beef pho and added meat balls ($20 total!). The texture of the noodles are a bit different than from the usual traditional viet restaurants I've been to. It's much thinner I believe. The real winner of this pho, which I think sets them apart from all the other viet places I've tried, is definitely their beef. Usually after cooking the beef to well done, the beef is tough at other places. But the beef Em uses is top quality -- the beef was so tender. I love their use of cilantro in the broth as well. It was a good bowl of pho, but for $20, I expected more protein. \\n\\nThe interior of this place is very nice and chic. This place is closed on Tuesdays so keep that in mind. Food is ready pretty quickly.\", 'Beef pho was delish. I also had the Vietnamese limeade, very refreshing and a wonderful alcohol free option. Very reasonable prices and at a lovely location near the waterfront in Brooklyn.', \"For the price of a bowl of beef pho which is close to $20, I would have expected more beef and also more noodles. I'm usually not a big eater but even I found this bowl of noodles to be way too small of a portion size. In fact, I was still hungry after my meal. My fiancé finished his so quick because the portion size was so small. \\n\\nI've gone to other Vietnamese restaurants that charge less and also give way more noodles and toppings. This bowl of beef pho only had a few slices of beef for topping. If you want any additional toppings, you have to pay extra. I think it's a bit insane given the price of the bowl already. Taste wise, I also thought it wasn't anything special and have eaten much better pho at other restaurants. Overall, I felt the beef pho here was very lacking. Probably wouldn't be coming back here. Honestly a bummer given this place has such high reviews!\", 'This is my new favorite Vietnamese spot in Brooklyn.  The service was fast and friendly.  Everything in the menu is delicious.  But must try fried tofu.', 'AMAZING\\n\\nIam not a Vietnamese food expert by any means but I really liked this place. The look and feel is very chill and modern. The portions are big,the food is delicious and the price is great.\\nI had the Beef Pho and I loved it, very aromatic and rich, it was too big for me to finish but I did have it to go. If you are in dumbo you must try', 'The food win here! The service meh. They\\'re not super mean or rude but the service staff has a \"I\\'d rather not be here\" vibe - too cool for school. Something to mention, the wait staff is not Vietnamese so it not a cultural thing. \\n\\nI got the chicken soup pho. The broth is very tasty and delicious! The chicken was very tender, surprisingly because white chicken shreds in pho are usually tough and dry. But this place does it well. They don\\'t bring a ton of fixings out like the sprouts, basil, lemon, etc. So if you want more you have to ask I guess. Also, the noodle to soup ratio leans more on the noodle side. I also ordered the ginger lemon tea which was a homemade hot concoction of sweet honey, tart lemon and spicy ginger. Very delicious!\\n\\nThe hot sauce they have is so yummy but beware is has msg, read the back label. But what ever that hot sauce is also wins! \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a good place for yummy semi-traditional Vietnamese food with ok service. Perfect for a cold day.', \"Stopped in on a very cold evening -- and ordered the pho ba (gluten free) and pho bo for main dishes. We started though with the yellow ginger tea (delicious -- tasted like warm lemon gelato with a ginger twist) and pea shoots (served warm in a garlic sauce -- very good). Both the pho ba and pho bo were hearty options with rice noodles and meat. Both came with extras to add in as desired. The proportions were hearty and we walked away quite full. The service was okay -- the waiters didn't seem particularly warm though they were busy. Overall, this seems like a good option.\", \"Em Vietnamese Bistro in Dumbo is a popular modern Vietnamese spot. We found ourselves there for early dinner, and it wouldn't have worked out otherwise because a queue started to form outside. \\n\\nI must add that the service is slow. We waited a good 5-10 min before anyone even spoke to us. And standing in front, like that, feeling unattended to is not a good feeling. They are understaffed as well. If that still is the case it might take a while for your dishes to arrive. \\nThe waiters are courteous and that's the better part of the service. The interior decor is bistro-y and feels nice.\\n\\nI do not know if I am alone in this, but I would rather have regular water. The water over here tastes different -- something's been added to it, and I do not dig it at all!\\nThe beef pho over here isn't any better than cheaper alternatives around the city. The beef stew is a good option. It comes with freshly baked bread that can be dipped into the stew. I think the beef stew was the better of the two dishes.\\n\\nA bit disappointing, especially considering the price and the hype.\", \"Pretty solid Vietnamese restaurant in DUMBO. I've never had the pho so I can't comment on it but they do a pretty solid job of the other Vietnamese dishes available. Lemongrass clams were briny and fragrant. Banh xeo was made super crisp and packed with goodies. They don't give enough lettuce/herbs but they just give you more upon asking. I do wish they had a larger variety of herbage but that's unlikely to happen in the neighborhood. Staff are polite and quite accomodating and the price is about in-line with what I would expect which makes this a pretty solid go-to spot for the neighborhood.\", \"A good Viet spot that hits the spot with a simple yet diverse menu. \\n\\nFried tofu is good but wasn't the most amazing thing. \\n\\nThe butter clams were good but not sure if it was worth the price tag. \\n\\nThe beef pho is good. Broth is what you would expect. \\n\\nDefinitely a spot to revisit if in the area.\", 'Gorgeous venue and lovely staff! Delicious drink options like the watermelon slushie. We started with the wings and chef veggie plate. Great flavors to both but especially the veggies, gobbled them down! For dinner we opted for the pho and pork vermicelli - great flavors, super fresh, generous portions. Great option in dumbo! We will 100% be back!', \"We came here with a pulsd deal that allowed us to get 2 entrees and a house bottle of wine for $39 before tax and tip. I love that em has a couple of dishes that you wouldn't find at other popular Vietnamese spots in NYC I ordered the Bo Kho and my girlfriend ordered the Pho Bo. The Bo Kho had great flavor though I wish the baguette they provided was a little less crusty (it was so hard soaking it in the stew barely helped). My girlfriend said that the pho bo didn't have as much depth of flavor as similar spots but was still good. Service was attentive. I'd definitely come back with the pulsd deal, but would be on the fence otherwise.\", \"The food was so good. I got the beef pho and I loved the broth. It was so tasty and the perfect amount of flavour. I loved it. My friend got the chicken broth and she said it was okay. But the beef broth was so good, I don't even like pho but I loved this place. Also my husband got this steak skillet , it was really good. He got it with a side of rice.\\n\\nService was good, our waiter was nice, took them kinda long to get out pho out , but we also came right when they opened.\\n\\nAmbiance is good, tables are spread out, you don't feel like your on top of one another. We paid $110 for 4 people and 1 appetiser, so not bad for dumbo. I will definitely come here again, my favourite Vietnamese place by far.\", \"A true Brooklyn standout, this restaurant does literally everything right -- affordable high-quality food with great portions expertly served in a cozy, yet seemingly upscale environment. This is the type of restaurant for any occasion. The bar seating provides a nice setting for solitary eating as well as small groups. \\n\\nWe went on New Year's Day in the evening as a group of 4; the tables were all booked, but there was plenty of seating at the bar. Still, it was not very noisy so it was easy to have a conversation with those around. Our server navigated the area very well, often having to maneuver around the table directly behind us. \\n\\nBun Thit Nuong (Pork Vermicelli) - An abundance of perfectly crisp grilled pork sat atop lightly seasoned vermicelli noodles, coupled with a small salad of romaine and cucumbers. This dish certainly filled me up. Don't think anything could have made this dish better -- it was great. \\n\\nCha Gio (Spring rolls) - Crispy, filled with fresh ingredients, and served with a light sweet sauce. Very good! \\n\\nDau Hu Chien (Crispy Tofu) - Crispy with fluffy tofu inside, these were also very good. Recommend this and the appetizer above! \\n\\nAlso ordered a red sangria which was tasty! \\n\\nValue: 5/5\\nQuality: 5/5\\nQuantity: 5/5\\nService: 5/5\\nAtmosphere: 5/5\", \"Definitely recommend a stop at Em. Amazing food - we got the chicken salad, Vietnamese crepe, and the bun thit nuong. I got the latter dish which was noodles, greens, carrots, peanuts, and grilled pork drizzled with sauce. The sauce was great as was the food. Worth the visit if you're around!\", \"Came here for a late lunch about a week ago. Let me begin by recommending everyone to dine here. The food is delicious, it's made to order, the prices are reasonable.  On this day, it seemed that the workers were understaffed. Our waiter was a bit frustrated and overwhelmed, but he really made an effort to provide us with good service.  I have no complaints!  \\nNow for the food:\\nAppetizers:  Fried Vietnamese spring rolls (Cha Gio)\\nMain course: Beef noodles in bone broth (Pho Bo)\\nCocktail:  La Vietnamita\\nDessert: Vietnamese iced coffee \\n\\nThe spring rolls were fantastic!  Fried to perfection, not oily, and well flavored!\\nThe Pho Bo is extraordinary! The beef bone broth is everything! The filet mignon pieces are lean and very tender.  \\nThe cocktail is refreshing with a nice buzz. ;-)\\nAnd, finally, there's the iced coffee which I wish were served at every cafe! It's smooth, bursting with flavor, perfectly sweetened!\", \"As a fan of their Bensonhurst location, I was intrigued and wanted to visit Em Vietnamese Bistro in one of my favorite neighborhoods in NY, DUMBO.\\n\\nThe interior was beautiful and the color scheme made me feel so royal eating there. On top of that, the food was delicious. The star for me was Ly's Chicken Wings - freshly fried and juicy, sweet with an umami flavor from the garlic butter nuoc mam and a slight kick from the chilis.\\n\\nIt was also my first time trying Hu Tieu Kho and it was an experience having the soup on the side of my noodles. Super flavorful broth and the soy sauce egg was sooo good. I also got the Watermelon Cooler which was just a watermelon slush - pretty standard, nothing to rave about.\\n\\nMy only complaint which brings this review down to a 4.5 is the Pho Bo here doesn't taste as good as the one I've tried at the Bensonhurst location. The broth wasn't as rich and the beef wasn't as tender. Nevertheless, it was still a solid dish if I hadn't tried their other location first.\\n\\nIf you're in the area, I recommend giving Em a shot. I'll definitely be back to try other dishes that are specialties to the DUMBO location.\", 'One of my favorite places in New York! Really great portion sizes, super flavorful broth in the beef pho, and great sauce for the vermicelli. Lots of seating and good vibes. Will definitely return!', \"Great restaurant. Clean, friendly staff + hot food. Went here to introduce my partner's mother to Vietnamese food. She was thoroughly impressed. I enjoyed my meal, however, I wish there was a big more variety on the menu. Vietnamese cuisine is a personal favorite and I tend to prefer more hole-in-the-wall type places when I'm seeking out pho and spring rolls.\", \"We were craving for Vietnamese food while in NY so decided to give it a try at Em, and turned to be surprisingly amazing experience. I ordered the Hu Tieu Kho and Ngheu Hap Xa.\\n\\nThe Hu Tieu Kho was a tasty dish with rice noodles and seafood. It had a great mix of flavors - savory, slightly sweet, and a bit spicy. The fresh herbs and bean sprouts added a nice crunch. The most delicious thing that made a great impression on me was the soy-marinated eggs.\\n\\nThe Ngheu Hap Xa, or steamed clams with lemongrass, were incredibly fresh and had a zesty, lemony taste.\\n\\nThis place feels authentic, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy. If you like Vietnamese food, you'll love it here. I can't wait to go back for more! Highly recommended!\", \"They didn't put our order in. We waited 1 hour for food. They comped our meal so I'm giving them 2 stars. Went on a Saturday night for dinner for two. Ordered drinks and noodles. My bun noodle dish was medium-good but I could list 7 other Vietnamese restaurants in nyc that are better. It's good if you're in dumbo I guess. Nice decor. Lively atmosphere. I would say overall, it's mid.\", \"Horrible service. We waited a while for anyone to even come greet us at the door. Finally, the guy came out  and was very rude, and didn't care to seat us and basically waved us away. I haven't had to experience in NYC before.\", 'We ended up here after ice skating under the Brooklyn Bridge. The clams and muscles were great but the pork belly is def a must have. Oh and the lychee martini was also a winner!', 'After crossing the Brooklyn Bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, we found Em Vietnamese Bistro.\\n\\nWe ordered pho, grilled chicken, vermicelli noodles with half-boiled eggs & shrimp and a bowl of oysters.\\n\\nEverything was delicious although we were sweating sipping the hot soups in the middle of summer in NYC, lol.', \"I stopped by Em's in DUMBO on a cold Saturday evening for a cozy dinner. Prior to my visit, I was already familiar with their original location in Bath Beach. Compared to the food from that location, the DUMBO one had a more fleshed out menu and included a lot of seafood offerings in addition to the classic hits like their pho and vermicelli dishes. \\n\\nWe ordered the spring rolls ($11) to start and their beef pho ($17), pork vermicelli ($17), and the beef stew ($20) as well as their mango smoothie ($10) and lemon ginger tea ($4). Their spring rolls were crispy and light and stuffed with chewy glass noodles, soft taro, and crunchy wood-ear mushrooms which gave such a great texture. Their beef pho was a little too sweet for my preference and compared to the other dishes we ordered, kind of just faded into the background. I do enjoy that it was a soup noodle dish which was very warming on the night we visited. The pork vermicelli was served dry with vermicelli noodles, lettuce, cucumber, mint, pickled carrots and daikon, and fried shallots that you toss together with the accompanying nước chấm dipping sauce. Their grilled pork was PHENOMENAL (as a matter of fact, their grilled dishes in general are amazing!) and so juicy and smoky. The beef stew was a really hearty dish and I definitely got beef bourguignon vibes as the stew was quite thick and fragrant. Instead of red wine though, the stew was flavored with lemongrass, ginger, and coconut. The vermicelli noodles were even better when slurped with the stew broth. \\n\\nWe also ordered a lemongrass pork chop and broken rice ($19) and another order of spring rolls to-go for someone else which was also very well received. In fact, the smoky fragrance of the pork chops permeated the car the whole ride back. Overall, I think I would like to return to try their bánh xèo and their seafood signatures.\", \"Solid solid place for Vietnamese. All of the items are presented so beautifully, and it's clear they use quality ingredients. I came with a group of six for lunch, and although we called ahead only half an hour before we arrived, they were able to accommodate us for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We got some apps and mains to share amongst the group, and also a few noodle dishes to split among the couples. Most of the items were good, a couple were just okay and did not stand out.\\n\\nCha gio (spring rolls): came out piping out, nice and crispy and as good, if not better, as compared to other places I have tried.\\n\\nGoi cuon (summer rolls): a little underwhelming, you had to dip into the peanut sauce to really get any flavor out of it. I usually love summer rolls but would skip this dish next time.\\n\\nLy's chicken wings: so good and flavorful! I was obsessed with the sauce (nuoc mam based) and other people in the group commented that you could really taste the fish sauce profile. Def recommend getting this.\\n\\nBo luc lac (shaking beef): probably my favorite thing we ordered, definitely get the side of rice with this so you can eat it over the rice with a little bit of sauce, ribeye, and yolky egg. It came out sizzling hot and you literally have to blow on it before taking a bit, and even then it is still too hot, but then you can't wait and you just eat it anyway. The beef is delicious, and everything on that platter is tasty - even the scallions, I finished every last one. The egg looks like it was freshly cracked just seconds before it leaves the kitchen, but by the time you dig into it, it's fine to eat. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this dish, as I have ordered it numerous times at other places and it never left an impression, until now. Get it!\\n\\nRice crepe (banh xeo): Beautifully made and presented. I thought the crepe itself was a little flavorless, so you definitely need to dip it into the nuoc mam sauce to get any flavor, which I thought was a little disappointing. However, many others in our group had never tried it before today and really liked it.\\n\\nBeef pho (pho bo): Broth was not memorable, but beef was perfect in that it was not cooked by the time the pho arrived. Lots of noodles, more than one person can eat on their own and perfect for us to share. Our server was great and brought us bowls so we could split it.\\n\\nBroken rice platter with pork chop (com suon nuong): liked it, the pork chop was well cooked and tasty! The pork and vermicelli loaf is interesting, a bit dry but not bad overall. The pork chop makes it worth ordering. \\n\\nPork and shrimp noodles (hu tieu kho): recommended by our server, and another group hit! It was my first time trying this, it seems like this is usually a soup-based noodle dish but this version was dry noodles with soup on the side, which we just added in. Everyone didn't know what to expect for this dish, but was pleasantly surprised and said they would order it again. Def worth checking out!\\n\\nFor drinks, they have something for everyone. We ordered Vietnamese coffee, a smoothie (the castaway), and beer. There's even mocktails on the menu!\\n\\nOur servers were great and very accommodating of our requests. We really enjoyed the tropical vibes, and the food and drinks!\", 'Had this place bookmarked for a while! They told us the summer rolls and the beef stew were sold out so I need to definitely come back for those. Was craving soup and thankfully the restaurant was nicely air conditioned for me to be able to enjoy pho without sweating up a storm. It was soooooo good! Definitely would come back for Vietnamese food craving fix! \\n\\n- PHO BO aka beef pho $16\\n- Spring Rolls 4 for $10', 'Em Vietnamese Bistro is a cute little spot with amazing food and great service. We ordered the Shaking Beef, Butter Clams, and the Dry Style Pork Noodles. Everything was extremely flavorful, well seasoned, and delicious! The Shaking Beef was tender and I wanted to drink all of the broth in the Butter Clams. The Dry Style Pork Noodles remind me of a dish in Cambodian cuisine - add just enough broth to mix the noodles up, and sip on the rest as a side. Service was extremely fast and attentive. We ate here before the Usher concert and ended up walking to Barclays Center afterwards to walk off our food coma but also because service was extremely quick.

Immediately craved this the day after the meal\", \"I would say this is a solid 3.5 stars. Came to try it out on a rainy Saturday for lunch with my family. You would need a reservation if you don't want to wait as the tables quickly filled up soon after opening and everyone had a reservation. \\n\\nWe ordered their takoyaki and yakisoba for the kids. The takoyaki was crispy on the outside, warm on the inside with a big piece of octopus. The only thing was I wished they were a bit more even with the sauce and mayo and a little bit more of the bonito flakes. The yakisoba was ok. Nothing very special and a little on the greasy side. The noodles however were al dente.\\n\\nI ordered their chirashi bowl and it was a disappointment. There were mainly low grade fishes and some did not seem very fresh. Their tuna was tasteless. In fact Hmart has better tuna than this bowl. The ikura was very fishy and unpleasant to eat. \\n\\nWe also ordered their pork belly nabe and this was by far the best and our favorite dish. There were plenty of pork and it had a nice meat to fat ratio. The broth was very flavorful and we loved the garlic sauce that came with it. If I were to come back, I would only order their nabe dishes and skip the rest of the items on their menu. It was reasonably priced at $27pp and you are allowed to order a single portion, which was enough for 2 people to enjoy. \\n\\nIt's a small cozy restaurant. It's clean and staff are all very friendly. It's a good option to enjoy during cold or rainy days.\", \"A cozy Christmas Eve dinner.\\n\\nCame here as the final stop of our NYC food tour and it was a pretty solid choice. We got a bunch of things to try:\\n\\nKushi katsu mini combo set (shiitake mushroom, shrimp, beef & asparagus): an okay start, the shiitake was a personal fave.\\n\\nGrilled whole squid: nice char with a sweet and savory sauce. \\n\\nSpicy tuna crackers: spicy tuna, crispy rice, avocado, jalapeño, and spicy mayo. This was very good! \\n\\nDouble salmon don: featuring thick salmon sashimi and minced salmon, my dining companion ate it all. I guess it was good. \\n\\nSushi rolls (eel avocado, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura): decent rolls but a tad too much rice. \\n\\nI also got a yuzu highball and it was quite boozy. \\n\\nService was really good and the atmosphere was nice and cozy. This was such an upgrade from the ramen place it was before. Overall, a pretty good meal and I'd return!\", \"There's not many restaurants that do sukiyaki so it was nice to see it on the menu. It was great for a cold winter day. The sukiyaki portion did seem smaller than the other nabes we saw around the restaurant. Personally felt like sukiyaki was a bit pricey at $34 per person since the portion size wasn't big. It was just enough. \\n\\nSukiyaki tasted not bad but was a little salty near the end. The egg provided was just okay - don't expect Japanese quality eggs. \\n\\nService was not bad in the beginning but at the end it felt a little rushed. They cleared up our food and then came with the bill immediately. We didn't even ask for the check so it felt like they were rushing us out. Not even mentioning that we could take our time or whatever since he came with the machine. We left and noticed restaurant wasn't even packed and no one was waiting outside. Didn't feel like they had to rush us out like that. \\n\\nOverall: food is okay/ average but felt pricey. The service is ok but felt like we were rushed out.\", 'Was craving a cozy soothing meal after sauntering around outside in cold weather. We put our name down for a table in their outdoor heated space, were quoted ~15min and were seated shortly after that time elapsed. The interior is thoughtfully decorated and staff kindly held doors open for me.\\n\\nI opted for the collagen pork belly hot pot, which arrived warm and took ~10min to come to boil. The broth was super rich; I can see how someone sensitive to saltiness would find it overwhelming. The dish was packed with cabbage, chicken, and ample pork trotter; I would have loved more tofu (there were only a couple pieces) and pork belly in it. The highlight of my meal was actually the beef intestine starter! It was cooked well and served with a luscious savory sauce.\\n\\nWait staff filled our waters and soups regularly, though we waited a while for our check after asking for it.', \"We got the Shabu shabu with pork belly and it was so good! The pork was so tender, and the broth was very flavorful I didn't even need the dipping sauces. We also got takoyaki which was very solid. \\n\\nFor the hot pot, the portions were huge. We got added just one udon for two people, and we had so much left (didn't even finish cooking a lot of the meat). I'm not sure if you could order this portion for 3 people unfortunately.... Would totally come back, and come expecting leftovers!\", 'Great food here but it can get very crowded due to it being near NYU. And St Marks.

The spicy salmon one was good too but nothing special. The avocado was the tiniest bit overripe but i loved the texture of the rice and flavoring too. Also the music was jazzy and classy!

If I just got the hotpot itself I would've gave this spot 5 stars but the apps and other sides bumped it down a bit for me.

The moment you walk down the stair to go to the restaurant you feel like you're being transported to Japan. The inside is a bit quaint and has Japanese music playing in the background which really sets the mood. \\n\\nFood: we got a few dishes to share and the portion sizes are generous, especially for the price. There were two standouts for me, the st marks roll and the spicy tuna crispy rice. They were so jam packed with flavor and just was a burst of flavors in my mouth. When I come back these are two that I would order over and over again! \\n\\nService: the staff here was nice and polite. They were quick to take our order and bring our food. \\n\\nOverall recommendation: definitely a must try!\", \"I enjoyed my meal at Kimura, but there are many rooms for improvement\\n\\nI was grateful that the staff boiled the beef for us in the first round. Unfortunately we were too broke to get Japanese wagyu, as the price per person would instantly jump from $30 to $70. \\n\\nPortion-wise, they put less vegetables and mushrooms in Sukiyaki compared to Shabu Shabu. Wished they gave us more shirataki noodles. Also there will be more slices if you get pork. \\n\\nAnother question: we order three person portion, but why the heck they only gave us two eggs to dip into?\\n\\nObviously it is not comparable to sukiyaki in Japan. Regardless, I am still down to go back and try their different nabe options as there aren't many similar restaurants in NYC. Mitsutaki or Motsunabe will be my next choice when I'm back to Kimura.\", 'Food (5/5): Came with a group of 7. We ordered the Sukiyaki for 3, Collagen for 3, and someone got their own hotpot. The Sukiyaki we got with Wagyu and it was delicious! Meat quality was high and soup was nice. The only issue was that later on it got a bit too sweet but overall still good. We also got beef, chicken, and pork skewers. The skewers were tender and good too.\\n\\nService (5/5): Solid service where they came over and helped us make the Hotpot dishes at our table initially. The Sukiyaki took a bit to come out but overall the dishes came at a good pace. My friends got a cake for my birthday at this time and the restaurant said we just needed to buy a dessert to bring it in.\\n\\nAmbiance (4/5): Nice restaurant with reasonably good amount of space and solid seating. It has a nice Japanese Izakaya type of vibe.', 'Came here first time with my friend. Definitely a must try spot in East village!\\n\\nWait was about 20-30 mins, we love walking around the area to check out the boba stores!\\n\\nIt was really nice inside, Japanese theme decor, really cozy. We both got the Pork belly Nabe set for 1 person ($26/ each). The adds on are pretty expensive, but you get pretty full after 1 set of hot pot ( I had to pack for togo for the rest)\\n\\nStaffs are so friendly, they came check on us often, and the set up/ sauces are all well presented. \\n\\nWould recommend coming here if you like to try shabu shabu!', \"Perfect for a chilly day! \\n\\nWe got the pork belly nabe which honestly would have been enough food for us (2 people) but we wanted to try other foods on the menu too. It is admittedly a lot of cabbage but I honestly don't mind. They provide 2 different sauces and a Japanese spice if you want to change up the flavor of the broth but the broth is pretty solid as is.\\n\\nThe only thing we didn't love were the skewers. We weren't expecting them to come out so fried and the thickness and sharpness of the batter was uncomfortable and not particularly tasty. Next time I'd come just for the soups and would skip the skewers.\", \"Food/Drinks: The food here was amazing and cozy. We got the Kushi Age Party Combo, in which we got to select 6 kinds of 12 skewers. That alone is enough to fill someone up. The seafood skewers were my favorite. For the hotpot, we went with the Pork Belly Nabe, which was so hearty and comforting. The sauces and oils they provide were also a nice touch of flavor to the hot pot's broth. We even got the Yuzu Margarita, which was nice and tart as we'd like it. It was refreshing with our meal. \\n\\nService: We had a lovely waitress check in on us often and she was just so sweet. She'd make conversation with us and fill us in with information about the dishes we were ordering. She also asked questions and informed us of how certain items were cooked, in case we had any issues, which I thought was nice of her. All the servers there in general would come by at steady rates to check up on us and help us out with our hot pot, which we appreciated. \\n\\nAmbiance: The place was decorated with a Japanese-inspired interior in mind, similar to the izakayas I went to in Japan, and the vibe is very cozy. The dim lighting weirdly makes the food more enjoyable, and we all complimented how it was designed.\", 'We arrived to Kimura 10min before opening on a weekend and there were 3 parties in front of us in line. They opened on time and there were no issues getting seated, with no reservation, but we were seated in the backyard heated room. Our waiter and the staff there were polite and friendly.\\nEverything we ordered was flavorful and delicious. Only complaint was I wish portion size was bigger. Haha.\\nBeef tongue slices (5pcs) $14 - marinated grilled tender slices \\nYuzu Miso Salmon $15 - Includes fresh salmon sashimi topped with yuzu miso and sesame ponzu sauce, green onion and onion slices\\nHakata Motsu Nabe $27/person - Includes beef intestines, cabbage, leek, tofu, burdock, and sesame, chili sauce on the side.\\nI would like to come back to try the of other nabe options.', 'A cozy and comforting nabe spot to warm up during the cold weather. I\\'ve been here a few times and love trying the different nabe broths and sets, which are all great for sharing. Aside from their delicious nabes, my friends were also in love with their matcha almond jelly dessert, which sounds a bit random but was tasty and memorable.\\n\\nThe restaurant also has a backyard area with separate covered \"rooms\", which is nice for a more private experience. Make reservations if possible, since the space is pretty small and gets busy quickly.', \"In the cold winter, Kimura is the place to go for a comforting bowl of Hakata Motsu Nabe--it's an absolute must-get. The broth is perfect and flavorful, warming you up from the inside out. I highly recommend asking for the yuzu dipping sauce--the tanginess perfectly balances the richness and heaviness of the intestine, making each bite even more enjoyable. If you're looking for a hearty and satisfying meal during the winter months, this dish is a winner!\", 'We ordered:\\n1. Hakata Motsu Nabe 博多もつ鍋 - Beef Intestine, cabbage, leek, tofu, sesame, chili, burdock\\n2. Kushiage Party combo - Beef, Chicken & Scallion, Pumpkin, Shiitake mushroom, Scallop, Salmon\\n\\nReally great, unique Japanese restaurant that specializes in Japanese hot pot. Our hot pot broth was rich and soothing in the cold temperature. I think they give you an appropriate portion for the number of people assuming you order at least one appetizer or other dish for the table. Kushiage were crispy and properly cooked inside. The bbq and mustard sauces were perfect for the skewers.\\n\\nService was good. They checked on us, even replaced a skewer that fell to the floor. We got outdoor seating which was in a tent with a heater. It was comfortable.', \"I made a reservation through resy for a group of 8 for my grandpas birthday for noon (lunch time). Don't know if it was because it was a holiday, Columbus day, but we could only order of the dinner menu, which was not a problem. Good attentive service and great ambience. Would definitely visit again.\\n\\nWhat we ordered:\\n- Karaage: crunchy and paired with a delicious sauce 8/10\\n- beef tongue slices: tender pieces and loved the texture 9/10\\n- pepper chicken: juicy chicken with a good heat from the black pepper 7/10\\n- sashimi deluxe 20 piece: fresh variety of fish - salmon, tuna, scallop, mackerel, and a few others 8/10\\n- dragon roll: standard roll with eel and avocado with sweet sauce 7/10\\n- seafood plum fried rice: perfectly cooked rice with nicely cooked mix seafood 7.5/10\\n- hakata motsu nabe: my favorite dish of the meal with my favorite beef intestines cooked table side and beautifully presented with some leeks, cabbage, tofu, chili that tasted very pure with its delicate flavor 10/10\\n- sukiyaki with u.s. wagyu beef: beef was wonderfully  tender and vegetables soaked up the sweet broth and cooked table side; my family loved this one 10/10\", 'The food was amazing. Got the for 2 tasting menu. The salmon sashimi was very tasty. The fried items could have gone better just grilled and it was too dry.  The sushi rolls was good esp the shrimp tempura. The nabe was a great portion size and could add noodles. Lastly the tofu dessert was refreshing and light. Service was good they helped cook the nabe and scoop them into bowl for us.', \"I like their grilled squid but hot pot is the obvious star here. The Pork Belly Nabe despite its name also has a plentiful amount of vegetables. I particularly dislike bean sprouts but everything cooked in the soup was so delicious, especially with the sauce and rice. I was very comfortably full afterwards without it feeling too heavy.\\n\\nIf you're not opposed to eating pig collagen, the Collagen Nabe is probably my go-to. It's little spicier and has a richer mouthfeel than the Pork Belly. Highly recommend trying it at least once.\\n\\nThey also have a nice selection of drinks here. I ordered their lycheemoni which was super refreshing and tasty.\\n\\nThis is the perfect place to go when it's cold out. (It's also super warm inside). Highly recommend making a reservation, especially for a group. It's a bit small and the place fills up fast.\", \"I am so excited to write this review! My husband and I were in the mood for sushi and hot pot so we decided to try this place out. Holy moly ! The that happiness flooded through my body when we walked through the door, let me tell you. We were greeted by friendly faces who sat us in a little nook in the back. The ambience, in my opinion, reminded me so much of Japan. We came at the perfect time because we took the last seat! \\n\\nWe ordered a pork belly, hot pot and sushi. Our server brought over our hot pot and tended to the hot pot and then served us when ready. While we were waiting for the hot pot to cook, I had a delicious Yuzu margarita, which I highly recommend! It had the perfect amount of sweet and salty citrus. \\n\\nThe food was absolutely incredible. The pork belly hot pot was a total flavor bomb! The sushi was incredibly fresh and delicious. I recommend definitely coming in groups or plan on taking some home because there is a lot of food for sure! We ate what we could! This would be the perfect meal, especially when it's really cold outside. If you were in the mood for hot pot and some deliciously, fresh sushi, I highly recommend this spot!!\", \"I've been to this place multiple times, the food has always been amazing. Beef intestine nabe doesn't disappoint. The soup is so delicious, I had refills three times. Pig feet nabe is on the mild flavor side, even though it's advertised as a bit spicy, I don't think you can quite tell the difference between the beef intestine nabe's natural spicy peppers from the red soup with pig feet, which one is more spicy.\\nService is good. Servers check in on you, not regularly but it's enough to meet my need.\\nWe came here both during lunch time and dinner time. There's certainly a longer wait in the evening and would recommend making a reservation.\\nAmbience is good for small party and casual dating. Can be loud depending on the people sitting next to you.\\nThe only reason I'm giving this place a four star is because their restroom is located in the basement with very tall stairs. Not very friendly for disabled. I didn't realize until I was having lunch here 40 weeks pregnant. Can be quite inconvenient for those who don't have strong legs.\", 'The waitstaff was super attentive and great with preparing our nabe as well as refilling our soup. The sushi was fresh and delicious. We ordered the collagen nabe and the hakata motsu nabe and we both felt that the hakata motsu nabe broth tasted better. The only con was that we came during lunch and I had to get up multiple times for the delivery guys to push their hand trucks filled with produce to the kitchen. It was quite annoying and made the dining experience mediocre by ruining the ambiance.', \"The atmosphere and decor is very nice. I joined the wait-list at around 4PM and even thought I was qouted an hour wait, the actual wait was around 30-40 mins. We were seated immediately and saw all the other bubbling pots of yummy food at the next table. \\n\\nWe were hungry so for two people, we ordered quite a bit. For starters, we got the beef tongue, yuzu Miso salmon, and the three assorted skewers (chicken skin, pork belly, and shiitake mushrooms. For main, we shared a US wagyu beef sukiyaki and udon. \\n\\nWe absolutely loved the beef tongue and yuzu Miso salmon starters. I'm salivating just thinking about those. The skewers were a bit of a miss for me. The chicken skin was rather chewy. The pork belly seemed dry. The best was the shiitake mushroom since it still had moisture retained after being cooked. \\n\\nOn to the sukiyaki! The beef portion for two is sufficient. Overall, the quality of the beef is nice but not great. With that said, it is especially yummy to dip the beef into the raw egg mix. I lalso ove the tofu in the sukiyaki. I could have more of those. Love the udon add-on as well. It soaked up all the yummy sukiyaki soup. Halfway into the sukiyaki, the soup started to get a little concentrated and became a little too sweet. But other than that, it is a great meal for a wintery day. \\n\\nI highly recommend Kimura and I look forward to trying their hot pot next time!\", \"My friends and I were a party of 10 to celebrate a birthday. The place was small but cozy. Service was great because workers were so helpful in explaining the types of sets they had and patient (it's hard to deal with larger groups) Food was a LOT\", 'First thing first, fair food. The sukiyaki with A5 Japanese wagyu beef was good.\\nYet I\\'ve had the WORST service ever.\\n\\nI\\'ve dined four times here. I enjoyed the food and service all the time. But not TODAY.\\nToday I was served with a male server with long hair. He seemed impatient when we first ordered food one by one then switched to the tasting menu. I mean, if a server gets impatient so easily, they should find another job!\\n\\nSecond, the restaurant intended to charge me $10 for outside drinks. Although there is a sign in front of the interior door indicating no outside food/drink, my friend and I sat in an outside cabin and we didn\\'t notice that sign. No one ever told us about this as well. When we finished dining, we ordered two milk tea. The server seemed pretty upset about it and yelled at us \"outside food is not allowed\". I was like okay and continued talking with my friend. \\n\\nAnd soon we were thirsty, and we didn\\'t want to drink the tap water two hour ago, so we took a sip of the milk tea. The server saw this and said \"no outside drinks\" in such an arrogant tone. I mean I can understand the restaurant doesn\\'t want customer to have outside drinks instead of buying theirs, but the server never gave us a new water during the two-hour dinner. I mean, this is still acceptable, until I wanted to check and found $10 was added to my bill without letting me know in the first place. The receipt is digital, so no paper receipt, no warning, no confirmation. If I didn\\'t insist asking for the receipt, the sneaky server can just stole my $10 without my consent.\\n\\nBesides, when I argued with him about this charge, he was soooo annoyed and asked me to never dine here again at Kimura. I mean, I was once a loyal customer here and you forced me to leave. FINE. You are not the only sukiyaki restaurant in NYC, and I believe people can find better service elsewhere.\\n\\nLastly, although I am way much unsatisfied about this server, I still paid 10% tip. I didn\\'t get a THANK YOU. If a server can\\'t learn how to respect customers then better take that lesson before being one.\\n\\nThis is the first time I wrote a negative review to a restaurant. \\n\\nThis is for people who want to dine in here at Kimura and get a service corresponding to the food price.\\n\\nWe paid over $200 and got such an awful experience. In short, I\\'ll never come back anymore, and I suggest anyone who would like to try this restaurant to think twice.', \"Still love this place, but noticed more technical issues this time.\\n\\nAmbience: we got to sit in the main part of the restaurant and it's so cozy\\n\\nThe menu was not updated in the digital - I was looking for the hotpot tasting menu and turns out that page was missing from the digital. Only the paper copy has it.\\nThey ran out of the best stuff - Hakata Lobster roll, Matcha Almond Tofu. I tried to sub the pork cheek from the tasting menu with the regular and it didn't come with saffron, which was a huge discount on flavor. \\n\\nService: We did appreciate their soups and got to try 3 hotpot flavors. The servers were very accommodating for 3 pots for 3 people's\", \"Kimura doesn't take reservations for groups of less than 4, so we waited 45 minutes on a Thursday night. We enjoyed the food though, so it was worth the wait. \\n\\nThe Yuzu Miso salmon was delicious and tasted very fresh. With the skewers combo, we tried the chicken skin, chicken thigh, and harami beef. The beef was quite tough and not my favorite. However, the chicken skin and chicken thigh were both great - very crispy and not dry at all. The value also seems better, as the combo is $20 but each individual skewer order is $9. \\n\\nCrab stick fried rice was alright for a side dish with all the meats, but on the more bland side. However, I've noticed that this is the case at most restaurants and not just Kimura. \\n\\nFor drinks, we each had a lycheemoni. The drink was quite sweet and even had a lychee inside.\", \"First time dining here, I must say I most certainly will be going back. The food was delicious (especially the wings) lol. Myself and 2 others orders a total of 4 servings of wings lol. We also ordered sushi which was just as good. The service was a tad bit slow but nothing terrible. The ambiance was perfect. We dined in a little area that seem to be outside but was enclosed. If you're looking for authentic Japanese food. This is your go to plac.\", \"Been meaning to check out this place for the longest time and finally got the chance! I always crave soupy things during the cold winter months, and if you're the same way i'd recommend checking this place out!\\n\\nThe sukiyaki broth is super rich and probably one of the best i've had in the city! The beef that came with the sukiyaki was also very fresh. Im usually try to avoid very fatty meats as they make me feel gross and oily sometimes, but the beef that came with the sukiyaki had the perfect amount of marbling that definitely made the meal that much more enjoyable!\", \"I'd never tried Nabe before, so I was excited when my friend brought me here. We split the Pork Belly Nabe, which was actually super filling and enjoyable, even on a hot day.\", 'First time having Japanese hotpot and it was a delightful surprise! We got the Sukiyaki with US Wagyu, which had a rich beef flavor and was very tender and fatty. The broth was incredibly savoury but unlike traditional Chinese hotpot broths, had a sweetness that made the broth so satisfying and  addicting (I love mixing sweet and savoury).\\n\\nWe also had the yuzu miso salmon and beef tongue,  which were marinated beautifully and flavoursome. The skewers (enoki bacon, beef asparagus) were also delicious, combining salty and savoury and delicate and kinds of textures.', 'Great service, nice experience. We ordered a pot with port, salmon as appetizer, and some deep fried skewers.', \"By far the coziest meal, perfect for a cold winter day! Kimura is known for their hotpot style meals featuring nabe, sukiyaki, and shabu shabu. They also have other options like sushi and fried rice. For a party of 3, we shared\\n\\n2 servings of A5 American Wagyu sukiyaki ($32/person, $64 total): this was delicious! Pretty on par with the ones I've had in Japan. Dipping the beef into the egg adds an excellent silky texture, and the marbling of the meat was beautiful. There were also a good amount vegetables such as carrots, enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage, etc. I highly recommend adding in a serving of udon noodles!\\n\\nYuzu miso salmon ($17): we had this as a starter. Good, but the sukiyaki definitely was the star of the show.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself had a nice ambience as well, and was deceptively large. Definitely put this on your list of restaurants to visit this winter!\", \"My friend and I came here on a Saturday for dinner (pretty much right at opening time) and it was already so busy! We ended up waiting around 30 min.\\n\\nWe ordered the Pork Belly Nabe and Yuzu Miso Salmon. Taste wise, I was a bit worried the Pork Belly Nabe would be too light since I'm used to really spicy Chinese hotpot, but I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful everything was. The rich soup paired with rice is a 10/10 combo. The Yuzu Miso Salmon was also super fresh and tasty.\\n\\nThe place is definitely on the pricier side but the portions are quite large; my friend and I got another meal out of the Nabe the next day. \\n\\nI'll definitely be stopping by again the next time I'm in New York.\", \"This is one of my new fave spots!! My friend and I split a single serving of the Kurobuta Nabe and it was the perfect size for us 2.\\n\\nI would highly recommend sitting in the backyard because of the cute ambiance and privacy! Can't wait to come back.\\n\\nWhat to order:\\n- Kurobuta Nabe\", \"There's no place like NYC during the Holidays! And I am so happy I had the chance to dine at Kimura during our visit. This place is a gem and I'm already dying to come back so I can try the hot pots and other dishes. \\n\\nService: Very attentive and fast. The waiter came by very often to accommodate us and refill our waters. The manager came by to say hello at the beginning of the meal and it set a nice tone for the evening.\\n\\nAvailability: I highly advise to book in advance as this place books up fairly quickly. \\n\\nAmbiance: Cozy and dimly lit; it makes for a welcoming and cozy experience especially during the cold day we visited. \\n\\nFood:\\n1. yuzu miso salmon: soooo tasty and delicious. I would order this dish again and again.\\n2. NYC roll: the mango added a nice touch. We enjoyed this roll very much.\\n3. Chicken karaage: crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Can't complain!\\n4. Teppan beef intestine: insane flavor and chewy texture. I loved eating it over plain white rice!\\n5. Goma saba: super fresh and tasty.\\n\\nConclusion: I am making it my mission to return to come back to try their hot pots! Loved this establishment!\", 'Kimura is my favorite spot to get shabu shabu in the city. They use the freshest ingredients to make sure their customers have the best shabu shabu experience! I always order the Sukiyaki which comes with your choice of American or Japanese wagyu beef. The broth is flavorful, the vegetables beautifully absorb the flavors, and the beef is tender. \\n\\nThe staff is also very attentive. They refill the broth if you run low, cook for you if you prefer, and ensure that your water glass is always full. They have a covered and heated outdoor area which feels cozy and intimate for date night!', \"Awesome place to get Japanese hot pot.\\n\\nThe collagen nabe that my friend and I had was really great. The broth is salty, but the depth of the flavour was so good. The price is kind of up there and the meat portion isn't too big, but there aren't many places like these in NYC unfortunately.\\n\\nThis place has vibes that you would see in restaurants in Japan. It seems pretty popular because people were already swarming in reservations when it opened for Saturday lunch. I would definitely recommend making a reservation if possible because getting seats in restaurants in St. Marks on a weekend can be tricky.\", \"Kimura was the spot I went to for my birthday with a friend and we knew we wanted sushi and some other small dishes on the side so we landed on this place. Arrived around 6:30 on a Thursday and we got seated right away, there's seating in the front, middle and outside both behind and into front of the restaurant but they do take reservations. \\n\\nMy friend and I got an order of sushi with shrimp inside and a combo of skewers and an order each of yakisoba. The yakisoba noddles were thin but came with good cuts my pork and some veggies on top. The sushi was flavorful and the shrimp tasted great as well. The skewers were a surprise since we didn't know that they call came fired, we ordered the chicken and scallion, shiitake mushroom, and shrimp for the combo and an extra order of the pork with cheese. The pork and cheese and the chicken with scallion were the best ones. And we also shared an order of octopus. \\n\\nOverall they have really great food, very friendly staff and fast service. I'd for sure come back again.\", \"Would sooo come back again to Kimura!!! Perfect meal for a cold or rainy day. I'd get a reservation though because it can get pretty busy.\\n\\nMy friends and I got the wagyu beef shabushabu and it was extremely filling - lots of veggies, tofu, and meat. I'd come back to try the other pots.\\n\\nService was very friendly and attentive as well.

It's a warmly lit and inviting restaurant and the service was excellent. \\n\\nWe each ordered the lunch set, which is a great value in my opinion. We got the dashi salads, which were quite large and delicious and another friend ordered the chashu, which they liked. We all ordered ramen as our mains; I ordered the miso ginger ramen which had a great broth and a little bit of a kick to it. My friends both ordered the tonkotsu ramen and they both enjoyed theirs as well. \\n\\nI would definitely come back here again!\", 'Ambiance: (5/5) Nice decor and plenty of seating. Benches kinda small and just wood, not good or bad, just something I noticed. \\n\\nPrice: (4/5) Prices seem average for the area.\\n\\nFood: (4/5) I really enjoyed the spicy ramen. It had a kick to it (nothing crazy, but notable because other ramen places say spicy and I feel like there is no spice at all). I liked the thinly sliced pork (as opposed to thick pork belly I see at other restaurants). We got extra noddles on the side and made it a great shareable dish. The gyoza came with a great spicy dipping sauce. I thought there could have been a couple more gyoza, but overall still a great experience.\\n\\nService: (4.5/5) food came out quick and service is reallyyyy fast. Maybe a little too fast haha there were a few times I was still working on something or wanted to keep a small sauce plate on the table but it was taken away too quickly', \"I came on a Saturday evening with a party of 4. We had no reservations but got really lucky because they sat us in 5 minutes. The place is packed so make sure you make your reservations!! My friend told me that this location is bigger than the Manhattan located (more seats). The place is dark and really cute!\\n\\nWe ordered the original wings to share and they were delicious! They were the perfect amount of crispy, spicy, flavorful, and juicy! \\n\\nI asked the waitress for ramen recommendations and she suggested the smoked dashi ramen. The noodles were the perfect texture but I didn't love the flavor. I wish I had gotten the tonkotsu ramen! I was really regretting it while I ate my ramen.\\n\\nAfter our ramen, we ordered two desserts to share: Tokyo banana and matcha kakigori. They were both really good! The brulee banana  on the dessert surprised me (in a good way) because I normally don't enjoy eating banana.\\n\\nI will go back and try the tonkotsu ramen!\", \"Craving some good ramen on a cold day - Tonchin is a must if you're looking for authentic ramen and solid flavors.

Walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night and got seated no problem. Loved the low lighting but liveliness of the atmosphere. Service was nice, quick, and attentive without being overwhelming. So many delicious options it was hard to choose from. The cocktails looked fantastic, but I opted for a non-alc beer.\\nI chose the spicy tantan ramen with extra noodles, and loved it! This was one of the few ramens I've had where it's sufficiently spicy without having to ask for more spice. The broth was delicious and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The pork was okay, I'm not the biggest chashu fan (I prefer pork belly). Despite the bowl being large, I couldn't let any go to waste and ate the whole bowl :)\", \"Street parking, but we had no issues finding a spot on a Thursday evening.\\n\\nService is attentive. We had a reservation for the dining room, which was comfortably spaced. We came on the early side, but it was already starting to get crowded. There was a line by the time we left.\\n\\nIt was Happy Hour when we arrived, so we decided to get a Half Dozen Oysters, which came with a yuzu vinaigrette. It was very fresh and great quality. The yuzu vinaigrette gave it a lovely citrus balance. The oysters are nicely separate from the shell, and if you prefer to eat it with a tiny fork, it's there too.\\n\\nThe Original Tebasaki has a soy marinade and spicy seasoning on it. It is well balanced in flavor with the chicken. I love the spiciness on it, though I'm surprised they don't have a non spicy version with how tasty their chicken is! They brought out wet wipes with it, so get your hands dirty!\\n\\nThe Tsukemen very flavorful, and not overly salty. Perfect whole wheat noodles to go with the heavier broth. It came with a lemon and sesame seeds that you can add to the broth to change the flavor, which made it lighter and toastier. The chasu was big and tender. \\n\\nI tried a sip of the broth of the Smoked Dashi, and if you enjoy that flavor, this is a must get! Comes with thin noodles and lots of clams!\\n\\nMomo drink was light and good accompaniment to the meal \\n\\nThe Tokyo Banana had some lovely bananas and light cream. I loved the mix of textures.\\n\\nEverything was fresh and great in flavor. Worth the trek for me!\", \"The ambiance was suuuper nice. It's great for date nights and friend groups! The service was also awesome as well. \\n\\nThe ramen though falls short IMO. I got the spicy tan tan ramen and for what it is, I think it's ok. The only memorable thing is that the ramen thankfully wasn't greasy. \\n\\nI think the highlight was the matcha kakigori. I usually don't like red beans because they get sweet but these weren't overwhelmingly sweet. This isn't a must-visit IMO. I think I just had really high expectations because of the hype. I'll still come back though!\", \"While Tonchin's on the pricier end, they have a pretty intriguing and well-executed menu. I came in January and was so glad I made a reservation for two at 7 p.m. because it was packed by 7:30-8.\\n\\nThe two of us split the smoked dashi ramen and the pizza ramen, which complemented each other well. The smoked dashi ramen was packed with rich, umami flavor, and I loved the clams and soft-boiled egg, but after a few bites it got pretty salty. Enter the lighter, vegetable-leaning pizza ramen, which provided great contrast. The blend of tomato sauce, tonkotsu broth, basil, and cheese worked surprisingly well together, and I was amazed that the breadsticks somehow remained crispy until the very end despite being submerged in broth.\\n\\nI'm constantly on the hunt for good kakigori, and the mango shaved ice was excellent. It's a massive combo of soft ice and layers of mango syrup, topped with velvety yet fluffy honey cream. It was a refreshing, not-too-sweet treat, the perfect follow-up after the ramen. I wasn't as fond of the soba panna cotta, which tasted like a rich blend of black sesame and coffee. The amount you get looks like very little, but the flavor is kinda heavy, so that makes sense. I'm glad I tried it but it was a little too much even for my savory-dessert-loving palate.\\n\\nOverall I enjoyed my meal, and hopefully I'll return at some point for the kakigori alone!\", \"Food:\\nThe ramen's good for the price. The broth is not too oily and noodles are not too thin or too thick. \\nThe mango shaved jce is pretty refreshing and the portion is huge.\\n\\nService: the only downside. There's not many tables when we visited but the server barely came to our table. It took us more than 20mins to finally be able to ask a server to get our check.\\n\\nWe went on a Saturday afternoon and there's no wait.\", \"The ramen here is SO good!! It was probably very close to being the best ramen I've had.  I got the pork ramen and I finished the whole bowl, which is unheard of for me.  My friend and I also tried the tuna tartar which was also so delicious.  We didn't have a reservation beforehand and were told the wait was 45 minutes but we luckily only had to wait about 15-20 minutes.  That service was a little slow but everyone was really nice\", \"Ended up coming to this location since they have a lot more reservations than their Manhattan counterpart (especially on a weekday).\\n\\nSplit an 8pc order of wings with my friend and also ordered the smoked dashi ramen.\\n\\nThe wings were solid! They're dry rub and have a pretty unique flavor to it. I think it's a bit on the pricier side for what you get.\\n\\nAs for the smoked dashi, I find it to be a very uniquely seafood forward ramen. If you've ever had dashi broth, this is basically a souped up version of that with clams. It's definitely not as common as their tonkatsu counterpart served across the states. I found the noodles nice and bouncy.\\n\\nOverall it was a solid bowl of ramen. I might pass on the wings though. Service was fine although it took a noticeably long time to get our ramen after we finished our wings. Was fine since I was mostly catching up with my friend. I think this places offers a solid bowl of ramen and is good for groups of 2-4 for a casual meal.\", \"Wow, I'm in love with Tonchin and I can't deny it. Seating options either at lower tables or the high ones you can find at a bar, with moody romantic candles, which the waitress had to come back and light for us twice. This Williamsburg location might be less popular than the Manhattan one due to the travel distance, thus we ordered the below:\\n\\nSmoked Dashi Ramen\\nSpicy Tantan Ramen with Nitamago-Soft Boiled Seasoned Egg\\nMango Shaved Ice\\n\\nThey are firm on not accepting substitutions, so you have to be content with everything that the ramen comes with. I initially wanted to order a meat broth ramen and sub the meat toppings for veggies, but the waitress let me know this wasn't feasible. The smoked dashi ramen was very umami and smokey, which I liked however given its price point, it was rather odd that they only had half an egg sitting in the bowl. Thankfully, the star of the show was and is the shaved ice which was everything we wanted and more! It was a hard decision between the Ichigo and Mango flavor, however we went with the latter which was so refreshing-the mango syrup and actual mango bites were a pleasant combination. Usually when one thinks of mango syrup or mango alone, you think of artificial sweetness, but this tasted 99.9% au naturel! \\n\\nI hope come summer they'll have more tropical flavors for shaved ice like lilikoi and they'll extend their last call time for desserts. Until then, I will be savoring vicariously through my photos.\", \"Tonchin has interesting ramen flavors and great service, but dark and depressing decor and expensive prices make this an OK recommendation from me. While everything was solid, our favorite was easily the tsukemen which came with an amazing dipping sauce. The noodles were also perfectly chewy and cooked.\\n\\nOverall, I think it's worth a try, but I would probably not come back again.\", 'Staff is friendly and the place was very clean. I got the classic Tonkatsu ramen which is good for the price. Biggest complaint about the place is the expected wait time is very long. Wanted to book a reservation the day prior but there were already no slots left so had to rely on the not so reliable walk in. The price is still a bit higher than most ramen places with stores in Jp so I would say this place is more of one you want to try out and leave it at that.', 'Homemade coke, PIZZA RAMEN, and mango shaved ice!!! This meal felt like something out of a dream, everything was so distinctly flavorful and while it was all excellent, the mango shaved ice stands out as the biggest surprise because it was so well presented and easy to share with a table (they serve chilled bowls with it to allow you to scoop into your bowl without it melting). \\n\\nAs far as the ramen itself... also outstanding. I never would have imagined \"pizza ramen\" would exist in this world but it somehow does and it is DELICIOUS.\\n\\nService was a bit slow but I\\'m not docking any points here because it\\'s a lovely environment to eat and hang out in and it didn\\'t bother me one bit that things took a little while. Good things come to those who wait, and if the food is gonna be this good, they can take as long as they need to as far as I\\'m concerned! We also ate around 7pm on a Saturday so the place was likely at its busiest.', \"Now Tochin almost got 5 stars out of me but after making us wait outside for them to have a little staff meeting, that's where they lost me lol. We got there on a Saturday at 12:25pm (they open at 12:30pm) and the door was open so we walked in. One of the ladies told us that they weren't ready yet. Since it was only 5 mins and it was freezing/slightly snowing out, we said we would stand inside and wait. That's when she told us we couldn't and we had to wait outside. Girl. You know it's cold out here. Sigh. So we went to the bar next door to have a mocktail and wait. We went back at 12:41pm and half the restaurant was full.  I'm like how did all these people get here in 11 minutes?? Anyways, we got seated and I already knew what I wanted. I got the vegan ginger miso ramen and it came out within minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed it and our server was so sweet. \\n\\nIt's a really cute spot in Williamsburg and worth checking out, especially if you haven't been to the one in Midtown. I'll definitely be back in the summer!\", \"As much as I wanted to like the pizza ramen, I just cant get my head around it. It was basically a margarita pizza in a liquid form, the combination of ingredients didn't result in a good taste in my opinion.\\n\\nHowever, it is unfortunate for such an amazing place to not have broth selection, instead of only pork. I would have loved to try other ramen but with veggies broth.\\n\\nI would point out that the vibe and environment of the place is amazing.\", \"Tonchin ramen transported me back to a superb ramen shop in Kyoto! We came around 1:30 pm on Saturday. Although busy, we were immediately seated. \\n\\nWe ordered the lunch set: smoked dashi with salad and spicy tonkantu with mushroom rice ball, and gyoza. The smoked dashi is definitely a favorite with a super flavorful broth. We love the curly noodles as they hold the broth and the fish eggs that add crunch to the dish. The dashi salad was so refreshing with a citrusy and umami flavor at the same time. Next time we'll get a full serving of the dashi salad!\", 'Fantastic ramen place in brooklyn. Their vegan ramen broth was so refreshing on a winter night. The potato appetizer is a must try as well.', \"I'm honestly not huge on ramen and don't find myself craving it very often but have been curious about tonchin for some time. Its Brooklyn location has particularly received good feedback so I knew I had no excuse since its in my neighborhood!\\n\\nI went on a Sunday without a reservation and think we waited 20ish minutes or so for a table. They were having a happy hour so got a glass of natural white wine to start which was so solid I ended up having two. I've always preferred dipping ramen to broth so opted for the spicy tsukemen. The portions here are massive. I feel like this order could've been split between two people. It was delicious-- perhaps not the most traditional (no chashu) but dipping broth was great, noodles slippery, and full of various toppings. \\n\\nThere were other small bites that piqued my interest so I'd be interested in coming for a bunch of apps as well as the shaved ice!\", \"Pretty solid place whether you're looking for a quick ramen lunch or a dinner with friends. Be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation, unless you want to come in right on open with 1-2 people.\\n\\nThe interior is well thought out! The sides have comfy cushioned seating, and the center tables are divided by a small wall that isn't intrusive. The light wooden accents also add to the ambiance.\\n\\nI got the classic miso tonkatsu ramen. It was solid, but I would recommend trying something else if you want to be wowed. My one nit is that the bamboo shoot was too chunky (not easy to eat multiple bites). They do have some interesting options, like the mayo rice ball addition and the tan tan spicy ramen.\\n\\nOn Saturday, sometimes they have a Japanese streetwear pop up in front too!\", \"Amazing ramen! I have found only a few places that serve great vegan ramen and I'm glad to report that this is one of them! I HIGHLY recommend making reservations since this place gets booked esp on weekends. We got the vegan miso ramen and vegan pizza ramen. The noodles and broth were FIREEE. The pizza ramen was definitely different and tasted tomato soup/grilled cheese aka comfort food. I'm so happy I found this place and will definitely be back!\", \"I didn't want to like Tonchin as much as I did.  I came in with a closed mind and looking for things to dislike.  To me, ramen should be affordable and tasty.  But wife wanted to try...once again she's right!\\n\\nThe decor is very romantic.  It's a warm Japanese-esque interior and the mid dining area gives you the feeling of dining outside.  Pretty cool.  We got the classic tonkotsu and ginger miso ramen.  Out of this world.  The ramen was chewy enough to be fun and broth was heavy enough where you can drain the bowl without feeling too guilty.  I didn't want to like the ginger miso since I was forced to have it.  I don't eat pork and ginger miso was my only option.  But I loved it.\\n\\nThe service was also fast and friendly.  No complaints there.\", \"Ordered smoked dashi ramen, loved the flavor and the broth. So why 2 stars? \\n1. EVERY single clam has sand in it. This is unacceptable. Cleaning the sand out of the clams is so easy and yet not done. \\n2. I'm mildly allergic to  bamboo shoots, and asked if my order contains any when I ordered. Server said no, and there were 2 bamboo shoots right on my ramen.\", \"Tonchin, the revered Japanese ramen restaurant, has found its home in Brooklyn, and my recent dining experience there was nothing short of extraordinary. Nestled in the heart of the borough, Tonchin Brooklyn stands as a testament to the artistry of ramen-making and the essence of authentic Japanese cuisine.\\n\\nTonchin Brooklyn's ramen is a culinary masterpiece, showcasing a perfect harmony of flavors, textures, and aromas. From the first steaming spoonful, it was evident that every bowl is crafted with meticulous attention to detail. The rich, flavorful broth, whether it's the classic tonkotsu or the spicy miso, is a testament to hours of simmering and meticulous seasoning. The noodles, with their ideal chewiness, absorb the essence of the broth, creating a delightful slurping experience. The toppings, from succulent chashu pork to perfectly soft-boiled eggs, add layers of complexity to each bite. Tonchin's ramen is an embodiment of Japanese culinary artistry, and it left me craving for more.\", \"Such an amazing ramen experience.  \\n\\nSpeakeasy environment with a great bar and sake choices. Reservations is a way to go. \\n\\nTook advantage of Sunday brunch menu and oyster happy hour. Bite the bullet and order more than 3 oysters, they are worth it. \\n\\nTonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu was my go to and the finest ramen I've ever had. Go ahead and order the extra noodles, you deserve it. \\n\\nFinished off with the mango shaved ice. Don't skip this part, I promise you will have room to eat dessert. \\n\\nPlace is worth every penny spent.\", \"I can't believe it's taken me this long to review Tonchin, but let me tell you I still dream of their food - it will def be a stop every time we make it to New York. \\n\\nWe had a large party and a reservation and they sat us down almost immediately. The restaurant is cute & intimate, it was nice and quiet until we got there haha. We started with the potato bites and Curry + Cheese wings. The potatoes were nice and crunchy and satisfying but let me tell you, those curry + cheese wings were SO GOOD. We ordered a 4 piece and after I had the first bite I told my boyfriend we needed more lol\\n\\nShortly after, piping hot next our ramen arrived. I ordered the Spicy Tantan Ramen (mini), it was so rich and flavorful and had a perfect kick of spice. I was also surprised at the portion for the mini! The cha-shu was so buttery soft and the eggs were delicious (I ordered an extra). My boyfriend ordered the Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu and was also very happy with how rich and flavorful the broth was. One of our friends ordered the Pizza Ramen and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with how spot-on the flavor was. Red sauce and I don't mix well, but I will admit it was tasty and def something different if you're up for it! \\n\\nNow whatever you do make sure you have room for dessert because their Shaved Ice is to die for! We ordered the Ichigo flavor and one of their other desserts the Tokyo Banana. Both were delicious but the Shaved Ice definitely stole the show. There was a cream on top that was to die for and the strawberry syrup was so fresh I could have eaten it by myself. The shaved ice was so good we ended up ordering another bc it was inhaled within minutes haha. I love banana-flavored desserts so I really enjoyed the Tokyo Banana (it also had a luscious coconut cream) but the shaved ice stole the show.\\n\\nLast but certainly not least our waitress was so sweet and patient with us as we were a large party. She shared all her favorites and best reccos and they were top-notch. Can't wait to come back again soon!\", \"My experience at this ramen spot was a delightful surprise! Arriving without a reservation at 5pm (they open at 5:30), we were pleasantly told that they could accommodate our party of four if we returned at the opening time. True to their word, we were seated promptly at 5:30, beating the small queue that had formed.\\n\\nThe menu offered an impressive variety of small bites, starting with oysters. Of the two types available, Island Creek and another whose name escapes me, the latter was a clear winner with its meatier and sweeter profile, complemented perfectly by a yuzu umami vinaigrette - a refreshing change from the usual cocktail sauce.\\n\\nWe ventured to try the coulotte (wagyu carpaccio), which was decent, though I realized that thinly sliced raw beef might not be to my taste. The curry+cheese wings, however, were a revelation! The perfect blend of flavors without being overpowering.\\n\\nThe grilled hamachi was typical yet satisfying. But the highlight was undoubtedly their ramen. We tried the Tonchin Classic Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen (standard fare), the Smoked Dashi Ramen (with an exceptional smoky flavor), and the Spicy Goma Tsukemen (pleasantly mild for those who prefer less heat). Their ramen noodles were the star - curly and bouncy, just as you'd hope!\\n\\nTo end on a sweet note, the Tokyo Banana dessert was outstanding, capturing the essence of the original Tokyo Banana snack without being overly sweet.\\n\\nService was quick and efficient, adding to the overall positive experience.\", \"Came here for dinner, gets packed so you need an rsvp. We tried the pizza ramen, tonkatsu and smoked dashing. Best was the tonkatsu, it was just an excellent broth and noodles. Second favorite was the pizza, interesting blend with tomato sauce, cheese, bread stick. I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't replace traditional ramen for me. Least favorite was the fashion, I've had seafood based ramen before but thought the flavor was a bit strong here and didn't enjoy the shells. Overall pretty good ramen. At $22 it's as pricey as it gets for this.\", \"Super trendy ramen restaurant. Lunch menu was nice, I got salad and seafood ramen. I enjoy cocktail, dessert and the vibe of the restaurant was great. Service was very friendly. My server told me they will have live music on another day I don't remember what day. I think this place is romantic and also good for group.\", \"Highly recommend Tonchin! \\n\\nThe ambiance is super classy and the music isn't loud. Overall a nice environment to have dinner. \\n\\nService was prompt and our server was super friendly. The menu walkthrough was much appreciated. \\n\\nFood Rundown: \\n\\nI ordered the classic ramen, and was satisfied with the noodles, thick broth and pork slices. \\n\\nThe chicken wing appetizer was tasty but pricy, and we enjoyed the salad appetizer more. \\n\\nLooking forward to coming back for the ramen and other appetizers soon!\", 'This restaurant is wonderful! I came here with my sister and friends to celebrate her birthday. The food is so delicious! I had classic ramen, and I just wanted to dive in the bowl. The dessert was so amazing! The shaved strawberry ice and cream were perfect. The service was outstanding! The ambiance is romantic. I absolutely recommend this restaurant!', \"Overall pretty good ramen. We got the spicy tantan ramen and vegan miso ginger ramen. The noodles were nice and chewy and the broth was flavorful. The ramen is a little bit on the pricier end but that might have to do with the fact that the midtown one is Michelin rated. We also shared the mango shaved ice. By the time we ordered dessert it got super busy and we waited quite some time for the dessert. There were bits of mango that was pretty fresh and other bits that were not. I'm not sure mango is season so that would explain it. \\n\\nI would say this would be a good date spot but it got so loud later on I could barely hear my friend.\", \"Second time we've stopped by Tonchin. The first time this place was SCRUMPTIOUS 10/10. This second time it was also solid but not perfect*\\n\\nStaff were all super, super friendly and accommodating. We arrived 15 minutes early for lunch on Sunday and they were able to seat us immediately. The vibe is always super nice and dimly lit.\\n\\nWe both opted for the lunch set. Both sets of rice balls were great! The dipping ramen was also solid, but nothing amazing and same with the spicy tan tan ramen. Only small annoyance (if I HAD to pick something) was the ramen came out like 5-10 minutes after we finished the rice balls, killing our appetite a little bit.\\n\\nSolid ramen spot, DEFINITELY stop by when they're doing any cool pop ups or sponsorships. I came here back during a parlor coffee pop up and both the ramen, side plates, and coffee were all exceptional! Would recommend!\", 'Great experience at Tonchin. The ambiance was very dark, moody and intimate, yet great for groups of people to gather for a meal. The food, drinks and dessert were all so delicious. My personal favorite was the dashi salad, which was so savory and unique. The ramen is the epitome of what good ramen should be, simple yet flavorful. I love that the broth, noodles and pork were not masked by other distracting add-ins or toppings, except for some scallions and a soft boiled egg. The service was really quick, and our waitress was really friendly, but did not blow us out of the water', 'Came on a rainy Saturday for lunch after an hour of hot yoga and getting stuck in the rain. Because of that ramen was a given need that day. I ordered the spicy ramen and it was good - broth was very savory and delicious, noodles were good, added a side of corn and that added great flavors - my only wish is there was more meat. the two you see in the picture was all i got. plus not a lot of veggies - still though the portion was quite large i was not able to finish all the noodles but i crushed the broth and meats. servers and staff are nice and the ambiance is cute and romantic - would recommend!', \"came here to try the pizza ramen mainly and i wasn't let down. in a table of 3 i was the only one who LOVED the pizza ramen i think it's because i'm a sucker for cheese and tomato. it's a pizza ramen but made well! their other ramens were pretty good as well! the portion doesn't look big but it'll fill you up fast...they're pretty heavy. service was friendly and we also got the flan as dessert which was AMAZING.\", \"- Food: was decent. My friend and I split the tartare, the classic tonkotsu and the smoked dashi. The tartare was excellent but we wish it came with something to eat it with other than a single small spoon. The classic tonkostu was great. Unfortunately, all the clams in my friend's smoked dashi still had sand in it, which was pretty disappointing. \\n\\n- Atmosphere: coming in at 5pm on a sunny day, being led back to an incredibly dark and quiet space felt disorienting. Our eyes eventually adjusted as did our speaking volume but it just felt a little funny considering how blinding the daylight was when we went back outside. I'm sure at night this location would be very romantic, but on a summery and sunny evening, the atmosphere inside seemed to miss it's mark.\\n\\n- Service: Being a restaurant on the Michelin guide, we assumed stellar service. We got there sharp for a 5pm ressy, and were left waiting by ourselves at the front of the restaurant for 5-10 minutes. After being seated, we were only checked on a couple of times throughout our meal. I don't want to be too picky here since I understand the difficulties of executing this right, but service was standard here, no better or worse than any regular restaurant.\\n\\nAll of this being said, I think Tonchin is a unique and one-of-kind experience. Given the price point, we expected better conditions and will likely not return and opt to go to Ichiran instead for quality ramen and a reasonable price.\", \"Come for the food, stay for the ambiance and service.\\n\\nThis is a very intimate restaurant with both front of the restaurant and back of the restaurant seating. The back is a little more buzzing (with tables and booths) but the front has high tables and low tables (2 seaters) and can be roomier depending on what type of theme you're looking for. It's good for couples and catching up with friends.\\n\\nThe Tonkotsu Ramen has a delicious broth, something that can be a hit or miss depending on which ramen restaurant you go to in NYC. The dipping version of this ramen is also available.\\n\\nThe appetizers that we got: White Tartare ($28) which came with a scoop of caviar and a small chip (if you want more it's $2 extra), was tasty but not sure if it was $28 tasty. The 6PC Wings were delicious and not too spicy, this was the better of the two appetizers.\\n\\nThe wine: We got a skin contact special (photo posted) which was recommended by the Som. This was a refreshing bottle for $68\\n\\nThe service was very attentive as well.\\n\\nFor 3 people our bill was $200 after tip.\", 'Awesome food with great service!\\nAlmost all tables were being served but service was spot on along with the spices...Highly recommend.', \"I want to preface this review by saying the Veggie Ramen Pizza I had was very good! However, I wish there were more non-pork based options. I'm a huge chicken ramen person and I get that the ramen here is different but as a non-pork eater I had to settle with the Veggie Ramen Pizza.\\n\\nThe classic Ramen is a great option if you do eat pork and would definitely recommend in that case. The restaurant itself is a cute date spot. The ambiance is great and right in the thick of Williamsburg.\", \"I arrived under a reservation and as I walked inside there wasn't a person in sight. I stood watching people run around without acknowledging me. As I walked back towards the entrance a man appeared and asked if I was waiting to be seated. Yes! \\n\\nOnce seated it took a while to wave down a waiter to order a drink. Very happy to see non alcoholic options. I went for green lemonade - they bring a lemonade and pour a thick matcha paste inside. I really liked it! But it was $12 which is kind of crazy. When I tried to make it at home, I couldn't get the matcha to be as thick. Curious what the trick is!\\n\\nOf course I got the vegan ginger miso ramen. And it was... Delicious. I'd say it's on my top list for vegan ramen. The broth was flavorful and rich and the noodles were perfect. The food truly made up for strangely slow service.\", \"Blown away by the ramen here! We came here around 6pm on a Tuesday night and there were no reservations available online but at lot of open 2 top tables we were able to grab. We had the pizza ramen which was just so interesting and delicious, I'm not sure I would get it again but I'm really glad I tried it and would recommend anyone to try it! We also got a classic ramen that was excellent and one of the very best I've ever had. So happy we came here and will def be back. Music was also great, the right level of noise and kept a chill vibe.\", 'Everything here was really great. The Williamsburg location is very nice, and we had no issue getting a same-day reservation. \\n\\nOur server was great, and the food was very good. The spicy ramen was my favorite. A little pricey for what it is but overall would likely come back!', \"We walked-in on a Sunday evening and we're able to get a table for three at the high tables near the front of the restaurant without wait. The vibe was very relaxing with real candlelit tables and dim lighting. \\n\\nWe weren't going to drink so we asked about the no alcohol options and they had this rose drink by Tost. The server offered us a taste first, just as of it was wine - I really appreciated that touch. It was delicious so we got full glasses all around. \\n\\nI got the tsukemen, which was aesthetically arranged. The flavor was excellent. It wasn't fatty like many dipping noodles can be. And it was also delicious as leftovers the next day.\", 'Intro: Went for lunch on a weekend. Comfy environment. \\n\\nFood: I ordered the spicy tantan men. Very good ramen - anything and everything you would expect from a ramen place in NYC. Noodles were the perfect texture and in a great proportion with the toppings. What stood out for me here was the broth: oftentimes, in spicy ramen the broth is overpoweringly a spicy flavor and nothing else. Here, you could taste the depth of flavor. \\n\\nTl;dr:  Solid ramen in NYC - love the broth. \\n\\nMy rating: 8/10', \"TLDR: The Williamsburg location of Michelin-starred Tonchin. Some classic menus items are here but very different vibes at this shop and different apps. The small plates are expensive. If you're going to come, stick with the ramen. If you can make the trip though, I would much rather go to the Midtown location.\\n\\nI was curious about the Brooklyn Tonchin since I heard they were opening. To be candid, didn't love it. The layout/interior is very different from the original. That's fine but I found the appetizers to be very expensive and the portions to be quite small. Maybe a bit too small given the cost.\\n\\nWagyu Coulotte. I guess something of a take on a carpaccio. Not bad but the beef was razor-thin and this thing was gone literally in seconds.\\n\\nShiitake. Mushrooms, tofu hummus. This was good but again, very small portion and to be honest just felt out of place. It seemed very random for the menu.\\n\\nNo gyoza? We did order a tartare dish but it actually never came. Service definitely needs to find its footing first.\\n\\nNo tsukemen at this location. Smoked Dashi + Tokyo Tonkotsu were both good,  not as good as the Midtown one but they were fine.\\n\\nIf you've wanted to try Tonchin and you're local to the area, it's cool place to have in the neighborhood. Drop in and grab a bowl.\\n\\nI think the portion sizes need to align with the prices and definitely service needs to improve. Personally - I'd much rather go to the Midtown location with the more extensive menu.\", \"Tonchin is my go to ramen place in NYC. I bring all my visitors to this place because I think their food is great. I knew I had to try the Williamsburg location since I like the midtown location so much.\\n\\nI was surprised to find out that this location has a different menu from the midtown location. My go to is usually the Tsukemen, but they don't have that at this location, so I decided to try the Smoked Dashi Ramen. I loved the ramen. The firmness of the noodles were perfect. My cousin had the Spicy Tan Tan Ramen, which was also amazing. \\n\\nWe also tried the Shiitake Bites, which is a hummus with thinly sliced bread, which is sort of like a crisp. The flavor was delicious. And the bread crisps went perfectly with it.\\n\\nI will for sure come back to this location. I just hope they start serving the Tsukemen here too!\", \"I've been a regular at Tonchin Brooklyn, and it's always a delight. The ramen is outstanding, with great attention to detail in every dish. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the location in Williamsburg is super convenient.

We got the fettuccini funghi, mafaldine scampi, and it came with a free piece of focaccia for each dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the flavors were amazing.

You order at the counter, get a number flag, find any open seat, and they bring out your food as soon as it's ready, which is never too long. The space is super clean with a great modern feel, with counter spots and tables. It is a smaller space though, and it can be a little tight to find an open table, so feel free to take it to go or delivery.\\n\\nI can't recommend this place enough!

They are priced very well with considerate staff and a pleasant ambience with the hidden room in the back. The food was intruiging too, but after trying my friend's pasta, which was even larger shape and even more al dente, I felt that the control on the hardness of the pasta needs a bit more care.\\n\\n(Trofie - Saturday Special: B) - This is a value deal of a pasta with fresh pasta, made and cooked right in front of you for less than $20! I really like the tomato based flavor with an intense flavor profile, and the short rib was very tender and paired well with the dish. The red onions were particularly interesting as the acidity help add some sharp contrast, but I would've liked to see more of it. My only restraint from this dish is the pasta is a bit too hard, so cooking it for 1 more minute would be preferable.\\n\\n(Cauliflower: A+) - The cauliflower is a stellar side all around for only $7! The roasted cauliflower is very tender and well seasoned. I was also particularly impressed by the flavor development of that dressing from the pine nuts to the olive oil and vinegar, to the herbs and chili.

The whole kitchen is on full display and it's very cool to watch. Got to chat with the manager (who is very friendly but I forgot his name) and he says they've been open for 5 years now. \\nThe pasta itself is so delicious.

You order up front and they bring the pasta to you - you get to see them make the pastas which is kinda cool! \\n\\nThere's two seating sections, one in the front and one in the back that's outside. We had to wait a while but we managed to get seats in the back. By the time we left at like 7:30 it did look like people were struggling to find seats and there was quite a line. But the ambiance outside in the back was really cute! It was perfect for the warm summery night. \\n\\nI got the Mafaldine Scampi - which I thought was honestly just okay. The sauce was really salty, I felt like I was guzzling so much water throughout my meal. The pasta was quite al dente, which I liked!

It's yummy, it's hearty, it's filling, it comes with bread and great service.\\n\\nI've tried the pipette ragu and the Friday special (lamb orecchiette) and both are SO good. The pipette ragu is a creamy but herby sauce, whereas the orecchiette is rich in flavor but not quite as heavy. They pair great together if you can share two with a buddy.\", \"Honestly a taaad overhyped to me, especially during peak busy hours. From the time we joined the line around 8pm on a Friday evening (it was out the door) to the time the pastas arrived at our table, it took about 45 min total. With the casual counter style service we were also stressed about snagging a table indoors but after just a couple min of hovering we were luckily able to get one. The wait staff were friendly despite the crowd, zooming in and out to deliver the hot plates of pastas to everyone.\\n\\nAs for the pastas themselves - we ordered the shrimp scampi (now $14) and the Friday special, lamb ragu ($17). There was no doubt that the pastas were fresh and perfectly Al dente but in my opinion both dishes were overly salted in flavor. Really decent portion size though and for the scampi, a fair amount of shrimps! The complimentary bread was also a nice touch and a great way to soak up the leftover pasta juices. At this price point I'd probably return only if the wait time was shorter or for takeout.\", \"Take out Review\\n\\nAfter spending the afternoon in Williamsburg we thought we'd grab some dinner to bring home with us.  Forma Pasta Factory seemed like a good choice.\\n\\nUpon arriving we found a line of people waiting to be seated and a packed house.  We were able to go in and place a takeout order without issue.  The order took about 20 minutes which isn't bad.\\n\\nI opt'd for the Pipette Ragu which included italian pork sausage in a creamy herb sauce.  The pasta was cooked perfectly even after reheating and the flavors were delicious.  This was such a warming and comforting dish. We also got the Saturday special which was Trofie which included red wine braised beef shoulder, roasted onions and shaved scallion.  Another wonderful dish with perfectly cooked pasta.\\n\\nAll the pasta is made fresh and you can watch while waiting for your order ot table.  Not to mention pricing is affordable and less than a lot of other places for a decent serving size.  A spot I'd definitely revisit.\", \"Honestly a solid 4 out of 5 - the pastas are really what you come here for. They're notoriously hand-made, cooked very well - as in al dente - with generous portions and tasty sauces.\\n\\nI got the malfadine pasta and my partner got the papardelle bolognese. Both very good - firm and slightly chewy pasta texture, as to be expected of pasta that is cooked well with expertise. My malfadine pasta had hints of lemon with generous portions of shrimp! The bolognese was perfectly tasty with a perfectly crafted balance of tomato sauce.\\n\\nHowever, if Forma stepped up their game a notch in regard to appetizers, they would definitely earned a 5/5 from me. We tried the caprese, arancini, and eggplant Parmesan. If you're really into authentic arancini, you may not like the ones they serve here. I thought they were okay but definitely Americanized/Hipster-esque. The appetizers were all in all def finely on the Hipster-esque American side as opposed to authentic Italian. Flavor-wise, Forma nailed the eggplant paramasan, however.\\n\\nDefinitely will come back for the pasta and lunch specials, however! Also, the fresh pasta looks promising as well. There's no Eataly in the Greenpoint neighborhood, but Forma is definitely a runner up for fresh pasta for Sunday pastas.\\n\\nYou can't beat $13 pastas as well as the $18 pasta and wine combos/$16 salad and pasta combos.\", \"One of the better/best pasta places I've been to.  Though there's usually a pretty decent line, there's also a lot of seating.  I'd recommend dining in, since their takeout portions seem to be slightly smaller for some reason (see below pictures for reference).  It's a nice date place or for small parties, given the ambiance.\\n\\nI personally like their entrees the best, over their salads and desserts.  The bolognese is excellent, while the pesto and the fettuccine are also tasty.  Salads are about average.  I'm a bit ambivalent about the arancini.  However, everything is quite affordable, no more than about $15 per dish.  And of course, their pasta is fabulous.  You can even buy the pasta separately.\\n\\nI'd go back again, but I'd try something new next time.  Probably can't go wrong with their menu.\", \"I ordered the pappardelle bolognese, and it came with focaccia. It quickly came out and was fresh. Everything was delicious!!!

Each dish was so flavorful and unique and everyone enjoyed having multiple things to try. We also ordered the mixed grill sampler to share and a few people ordered the lamb shanks which were a hit.

Now there isn\\'t a shortage of Lebanese restaurants in NY/NJ thankfully but Au Za\\'atar is doing things a bit differently - it\\'s more modern, elegant, and sophisticated take on Lebanese cuisine. We started off with the Frozen Mint Lemonada which is a Lebanese classic! It was refreshing, lightly sweet, and slightly sour from the lemon. A great combination of flavors. For appetizers, we decided to share the Mezze & Dips Spinner and Sambousik Lahme which was plenty for a party of 4. I particularly liked the Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, and Tabouli Salad of the 6 offered. Also, there\\'s no substitutions to this which makes no sense to me considering they can easily swap these out for something of equal or lesser value or even make them fully customizable having diners choose 6 options. For what it is, it\\'s not worth the price at ~$66. The Sambousik Lahme was on the dry side; the Mezze & Dips helped with that but I wasn\\'t eager to go back for a second one. Now onto the Lamb Tableside Shawarma! It\\'s a real show stopper. I love the concept, the presentation, and table-side service where they cut it in front of you. This can easily feed 4-6 people, in my opinion, but for $128 (chicken) or $158 (beef or lamb), it\\'s a steep price for what you\\'re getting. The Lamb Shawarma was extremely dry and overcooked, the Sumac Fries were outrageously delicious and addicting, and I love their toum (garlic aioli) and the garlic tahini type sauce. Our waitress wasn\\'t attentive at all which took away from the experience unfortunately. If she had come by more frequently, the meat would\\'ve been less dry if she rotated it more. In addition, when she was packing up our leftovers, she cut off a good amount and asked \"is this fine?\" I don\\'t understand why she wouldn\\'t just take everything off the spit and package it. Considering we had already asked numerous times and she was slow, we just accepted what she gave us but the food waste wasn\\'t necessary at all. Similar instances happened where we had to ask for items numerous times (our drinks, the bill, to-go containers, etc.). Overall, it was a unique and fun experience, the decor and ambiance are elevated, and the menu is true to Lebanese roots. Your experience might be different but prepare to drop some money here!', \"Service was great. Arthur helped us and he was friendly and patient. \\n\\nI accompanied a friend despite me not being hungry, of course I had to order something. I ordered the  shish tawook salad. Oh my goodness that chicken was so tender and flavorful, probably the best I've ever had. Highly recommend you try it.\\n\\nThey also make fresh bread which is always a plus. \\n\\nThe restaurant inside is gorgeous, I love it. We were sat as soon as we arrived so wait time around 7pm or so wasn't bad at all. \\n\\nOverall I would recommend it.\\n\\nWondering about parking?

I waited for my girlfriends at the bar.\\n\\nWhile waiting I ordered the Lebanese Please cocktail.  10 out of 10!  It wasn't too sweet and had a kick to it.  Maybe the bartender took pity on me for having to stand there so long but if that's the case I'm glad if he did.\\n\\nOur waitress came over to take our drink orders and she seemed like she was afraid of us or something - she spoke very softly and stood away from the table like she didn't want to get too close.  A few minutes later she came back with a different waiter to tell us he was going to wait on us.  We said ok thinking her shift was over but it wasn't.  Every time our waiter came over to take an order she would run over too - it was so weird.  Also even the waiter spoke so softly we could barely hear him. When it was time for the bill the waitress came to hand us the check - by this point we were totally confused as to what was going on since she didn't leave like we thought maybe she didn't want to serve us?  I don't know but it was totally confusing.\\n\\nOnto the food......we started with hummus and grilled chicken wings.  The hummus comes with the softest, fluffiest pita I have EVER had.  Both the wings and the hummus were really good - no complaints there.\\n\\nWe had to get the lamb shawarma tower - again another hit!  The lamb was moist and well seasoned and those fries were to die for!\\n\\nFor dessert we shared the pyramid and chocolate mousse cake - they were both really good as well.\\n\\nConsidering the price point of this restaurant I would think the service would be a little better than what we experienced but the food made up for it.\", \"Came here for a little lunch on the weekend. At 1pm, they gave us the lunch and brunch menu. We tried a few of their dips- hummus, labneh and feta and pistachio puree. The hummus with the toasted pine nuts was my favorite. They bring you warm, fresh pita which they kept bringing out as we kept mopping up all the dips with it. They have a decent cocktail menu. The Sahran was my favorite, I'm partial to tequila/mezcal and this cocktail had mezcal and watermelon. It wasn't too sweet which I enjoyed. The entrees were large portions, especially the brunch menu items. Their fries are banging. For dessert, I enjoyed their knafeh. I wish the top was crispier on it but it was overall pretty good. The ice cream was not that great, very strong and artificial rose taste. \\nThe service was great, very attentive and quick. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu.\", \"Really high quality, delicious Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food at Au Za'atar. Everything from the grilled meats to the flavorful fries and the mezze's, this restaurant is so good. \\n\\nDefinitely a great restaurant for a night out.\", 'Helen greeted us with such warmth and energy that we knew we were in for something special and the recommendations she gave her spot on. From the first bite, every dish felt like a celebration of flavors. The Spicy Hummus was perfectly balanced with just the right kick, the Meat Flatbread was hearty and satisfying, and the off-menu Shawarma? A true hidden gem.', \"Au Za'atar is one of my favorite spots right now. It's super busy (for good reason) and it's a fun place to spend an evening. The food is INCREDIBLE. You could probably fill up on the mezze - the pistachio feta, hummus with lamb, and muhammura were some of my favorites BUT you really need to try the mixed platter. The steak is outstanding.\", \"I recently ordered takeout from Au Zaatar, trying their lamb kebab pita sandwich, muhammara, shish tawook platter, and baklava. The sandwich was decent, but the muhammara was a highlight - flavorful and well-made. However, I've had better Middle Eastern food in the city at this price point. Unfortunately, the baklava was a letdown - dry and not as impressive as I'd hoped.\\n\\nOne notable aspect was the excellent packaging for takeout - it was clear they put thought into presentation. While my experience earns them a solid 3.5, I'm willing to give Au Zaatar another try. Maybe next time, I'll be more impressed!\", \"I had a lovely dinner here on a Thursday summer evening. Our party of three sat outside. I didn't get to see much of the indoor decor, but the bathroom had beautiful wallpaper (or tiling? It was quite dark) and smelled great.\\nFor outdoor dining, they wrap the napkins and utensils in plastic wrap, which is great for sanitation; not so great for the environment.\\n\\nTheir cocktail menu was on the pricier side. All the drinks were $20 and up. I got the Golden Days. It was sweet with a bit of tartness from the passionfruit. Very juicy. I enjoyed it.\\n\\nWe shared several dishes. My favorite was the arnabeet bi tarator, which was fried cauliflower in a yogurt sauce. It was flavorful and the cauliflower was perfectly tender. I also enjoyed the baba ganoush. It was creamy and had large chunks of eggplant. The hummus beiruty was tasty, but the flavor from the fava beans was quite subtle. The spicy falafel was not at all spicy, but it was crunchy and satsifying. The fatayer fitter mushroom tarts were also a top dish for me. They were buttery and rich from the dough and caramelized onions. The vegetarian kibbeh naye was a bit mushy for my taste, but my friend loved it.\\n\\nThe food arrived very quickly. It was a little hard to flag our waitress down to get the check. But otherwise, definitely recommend a visit!\", \"Inside is beautiful and huge! Plentiful seating both inside and outside - don't think you would even need a reservation tbh. I heard people walk in for a party of 8 and was seated immediately so lol. The staff were all very pleasant and polite. They were very attentive and kept bringing us more pita bread and dips! \\n\\nWe came here specifically for the Tableside shawarma and it did not disappoint! Definitely lived up to our expectations. The meat was so tender and juicy and flavorful. It paired so well with the white sauce! I don't remember the name but this sauce was DELICIOUS I could drink it. I had the lamb shawarma both by itself and wrapped in pita, and both were amazing. I am the biggest bread girl so I was extremely happy about the unlimited pita bread refills. I went through so many pita breads and they were all sooooo warm and yummy. The BEST item of our entire night was definitely the fries!!! The fries were so well seasoned and crispy and cooked to perfection. They were absolutely addicting, I couldn't get enough!! The seasoning on these was to die for. I could drown in a pool of these fries. By far the best item on the menu and the fries I've ever had. We also got the cauliflower with yogurt sauce, which was so good. The fattoush salad was very refreshing and even came with pomegranates, which made the entire salad 10x better. However, the spicy hummus was so bad. We didn't even end up finishing the spicy hummus. Do not recommend this :(\\n\\nOverall, great experience and loved the tableside shawarma! Would definitely come back again and try their other dishes too.\", \"Au Za'atar is what I'd call a higher-end Lebanese restaurant where you can still walk in wearing shorts and a shirt (although people may judge).\\n\\nI'm plant-based and although there were some limited available, everything felt so overpriced for simple dishes like veggie kebabs... I mean $40!? That is a crime.\\n\\nMy table who were not vegan or vegetarian were happy to split the hummus together (almost $18) but I couldn't muster shelving out more money so I went with their Lentil Soup and swallowed my pride. The soup was nice and creamy and was able to keep me from starving lol.\\n\\nI'd say that as a vegan I probably would not come here unless you were with a larger group, and perhaps try to find a way to eat beforehand unless you're willing to spend much higher-than-average prices for pretty simple ingredients.\", \"Came here in a Sunday evening after my daughter's football game. Even though there were plenty of tables available outside (weather was still fine), had to wait 20+ mins to be seated outside. We were the only people who had to wait. I guess they were under-staffed ??\\nFood was pretty good and once we ordered the food arrived reasonably quickly. \\nThey just need to be better organized!\", \"This location is much better than the East Village one, given its selection is much more expansive.\\n\\nHowever, when you come at dinner time and it's busy expect they will bring all your food very quickly so your once small spacious table will be overloaded with food. \\n\\nThe food overall is very good, definitely will need to come back to give all the various items a try.\", \"This place was amazing! I haven't tried Lebanese food prior to Au Za'atar, but now I will make this a consistent food group in my diet. My table of 5 ordered the one dish scene in my photo and it was enough for us all and then some. It was absolutely delicious. Service was great - we sat outside but will definitely need to check out the interior next time.\", 'Food top notch. Tried baba ganoush which was served with delicious side dips as well as 3 different spice blends (hot, medium and tahini). The pita was to die for! We also tried the Kibdeh (lamb liver) which apparently was delicious but I didn\\'t try. We also had the baby lamb chops and shish tawook (aka chicken kebab). The lamb was perfectly cooked and the chicken had great flavor. One person said it was a little dry but I thought the seasoning overcame that. We also ordered the spinach side which was \"meh\". Unless you need your daily dose of greens (which we did), I wouldn\\'t bother! We had a bottle of Lebanese red wine which was very smooth and tasty. The service was friendly and knowledgeable and the space has a cool vibe. I\\'ll definitely we back as there were bunch of dishes I can\\'t wait to try!', \"Love Au Za'atar on the LES so wanted to check out this location as it was much closer. Not sure why it felt like there was a difference, felt like the food might've been better at the LES location but this one was still pretty good. Got the mixed grill and a variety of the dips, which they do a great job with their texture and authenticity. Frozen watermelon was a refreshing treat for the hot summer.\\n\\nThe meat was tender, and delicious and the pita was soft. Really a solid place especially for big parties since they have fair amount of seating. They're also doing an important job of bringing some quality international food to Midtown which can be a bit of a food desert at times.\", 'Great ambiance and seating outside and inside and by the breeze. Lighting and decor was lit well for a nice evening.\\nService was quick and not too pushy as drinks and apps arrived first and main took time which I prefer to avoid a rush table service\\nFood was cooked well as I love halloumi and I had shish tawook but forgot a photo as it was cooked well and had plenty of sauce options.\\nGo to spot on a quiet spot on the east side.', \"Outstanding Lebanese restaurant! We walked in on a Saturday night and were able to snag a couple seats at the bar. The bar is quite nice with a white stone counter top and glass back drop. To boot, they had a pretty good selection of whiskeys and even a few intriguing mezcals. \\n\\nDon't overlook the beverage options here They had a middle eastern inspired cocktail list. My wife had their take on a mojito which she loved. I had a glass of wine as they had a few Lebanese options which appealed to me. It seemed like the frozen drinks were a hit as the bartenders kept making what looked to pina coladas and another blended drink with a date liquor. \\n\\nIn regard to food, we shared the hummus with lamb and the fatayer fritter. Hummus was solid, but it was the accompaniments that blew me away. It came with small, yet hot and airy pitas that were eaten faster than they were served. Probably could have consumed a dozen of these. It came with three superb sauces. The best one was an orange pepper sauce. Incredibly rich with what tasted like slow, built up flavors. It also came with a jalapeño sauce and a tahini sauce that were excellent too.\\n\\nThe hummus came with a few small plates. There were pickles, a pickled root vegetable (I believe turnips), a garlic labneh, and another dip that reminded us of ranch a bit. \\n\\nThe other dish we had was called a fatayer fritter, but the description did it most justice. It was described as an open faced pie with mushrooms, cheese, and caramelized onions. These little pastries were savory and flakey. They presented another opportunity to use the incredible sauces.\\n\\nService was attentive. The pacing of the food worked out nicely. The atmosphere was modern and most guests dressed nicely. They had a couple single occupancy restrooms which were spacious. Lots of outdoor seating making it a nice spot to enjoy a beautiful evening.\", 'Delicious food. Service a little slow but the food was tasty. Price is good for the food', \"Super easy to get a reservation day of, and the food was amazing both times we went. There seems to be a line at the door and the restaurant was pretty full both times, so it's good that we got a reservation.\\nThe pita ovens are visible from the dining room, and it's fun to watch all the bread puff up.\\nThe tableside shawarma platters are definitely the stars of the show. We couldn't find it on the menu, but asked for it when we saw other tables getting it. Came in chicken, beef, or lamb. We got the chicken and it was delicious! The chicken and a mezze platter was good amount of food for 4 people, and we had leftovers for another meal as well.\\nThe Lebanese beers with lemon and salt were delicious, and very refreshing.\", 'The best food we ate in NY. Ordered it 4 times over one week. Please please open in Los Angeles!', 'Wow. Just wow. We were visiting New York I found this place via tiktok and I was so impressed. The food, the service, the ambiance, it had it all. \\n\\nThe food tasted soooooo good, best to go in groups so that you can try more options! Even though we were a group we had food left over. They also make their pitas in house and I love that so much! \\n\\nThe service was great - our server was great at providing his recommendations and favorites. \\n\\nAmbiance - dim, nice decor, nice bar area, nice outdoor patio seating \\n\\nI would definitely visit back!', \"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our Valentine's Day dinner at Au Za'atar tonight.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive and we were overwhelmed, but our delightful waitress took time to explain the menu and some of their most popular dishes. We ended up ordering their Hummus Bi Djaj, and their Mixed Grill Platter. Without knowing the portion size, we were going to order another dish, but thankfully, our waitress advised against it. SO MUCH FOOD, especially with their complimentary pita and sauces. \\nOur favorite of the night was the hummus which was topped with tender marinated chicken and pine nuts. It paired perfectly with their pita. The mixed grill platter was also very good with a hearty sampling of different meat and flavors.\\n\\nEverything was simply excellent.\\n\\nNote:\\n- While there are plenty of tables inside the restaurant and in their outdoor dining area, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance especially for holidays like Valentine's.\", \"We were able to get a same day dinner reservation for a group of 12 during the week. If this was the east village location it won't have been possible. The staffs are so friendly and accommodating. We stayed for a long time because people were running late and we took awhile to order our food. However, we never felt rushed by the staff. \\n\\nWe ordered many items to share and also our own entrees. I liked everything we ate! We got some hummus, pies, etc to share. The only thing I didn't like was the whole branzino was a bit difficult to eat and you have to watch out for the bones. \\n\\nThe cocktails were also a hit! I stuck with my regular wine options but I was definitely tempted to order some of their cocktail options. \\n\\nThe ambiance is very classy - I saw many people coming here for a date night. They also have a bar area as well.\", \"OMG I can't wait to come back. My fiance and I visited for a light snack as we were not very hungry which is my biggest regret. Next time I will come hungry. \\n\\nWe ordered a couple of veggi mezes and they were awesome. \\n\\nARNABEET MEKLE (fried cauliflower)\\n\\nFATTET AL-BETENJANE (egglplant)\\n\\nBoth were booming with flavor. and the accompanying sauces were excellent. \\n\\nThe ambiance is also very CHIC yet also cozy. \\n\\nThere are so many things I want to try on the menu. My strategy would be to come in a large group. The restaurant space is large with many large tables.\", 'My husband and I came here twice and I enjoyed both experiences a lot! The decor is very nice and service is great! Food has been amazing both times! Whenever I go into Manhattan I always try to eat at a new restaurant, but I will always come here whenever I can! My husband has been here a lot more times than I have, and he has always had a good experience each time', \"A wonderful location for fine dining with delicious plates perfect for sharing.\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered multiple small plates including the Muhammara, Batata Harra, Halloum, Za'atar Manouche, and Jwaneh. Tableside Pita and a variety of dips/sauces are complimentary throughout the meal. I LOVED the hot sauce & garlic aioli specifically. The quality and service here is top notch! \\n\\nThe vibes here are elegant and perfect for a little more upscale dining experience. This restaurant is perfect for a communal and intimate dining experiences. Def recommend going with a group so you can sample multiple small plates. I want to go back for the tableside chicken shawarma next ...\", \"Decor is very nice but it's too pricey for what you get and the food is not even as good as you'd think. The mhamara is way too sweet, the halloumi cheese salad had wayy too much lemon, and they give you bunch of sauces for some reason? We didn't even order any meats to dip them in, kind of strange. Definitely didn't feel authentic at all. Not sure if I'll be back.\", 'Love the food and the service. The vibe was just right for the night ! The lamb shank was so tender .. do try it !!', \"Food: 5/5\\nThe food was incredible! The hummus was amazing and the proteins we were served in our platter were delicious. \\n\\nService: 10/5\\nThe service was impeccable! Our waiter was Flavio and he helped us with our order. It was our first time in Au Za'atar and having Flavio recommend and assist us along the way was so helpful! Thanks Flavio! You are awesome! \\n\\nAmbiance: 5/5\\nBeautiful decor, great music, love the lighting and open space they have. Whenever I'm back in NY I'm coming back\", \"We had a birthday celebration here and the atmosphere was really nice and fancy. We ordered 3 appetizers and the entire shawarma on the skewer stand  which came with fresh pitas, French fries and different dips. For apples we got hummus with beef chicks, spring rolls with cheese inside and pita bread with minced beef. I forgot the actual names of these items on the menu. The service was efficient and attentive and the food was tasty. The shawarma on the stick was an experience because we got to shave it ourselves and the portion was huge. It wasn't in the menu and the waiter was able to place the order because that's what we mainly went to this restaurant for. It was pricey though. Overall it was a nice experience and we all loved it.\", \"This Lebanese restaurant has this newer location in midtown east. They have their other location in the East Village. \\n\\nThis restaurant is on the bigger side. They have many tables inside and outdoors as well. We sat towards the back area. It does get noisy and they have music playing a bit loud. But hey it's good music. The setting to this restaurant its on the dark side with lights\\ndim. But there are lamps on tables to help see menu. I will say at first it was a bit hard to find the restroom. I ended up going ti the front and asking a waitress where it was. She showed me and it turned out to be actually right where we were seated. It was kinda hard to tell that that was the bathroom entrance. The bathrooms are also on the dark side. And there are only two. There is a little waiting area with a seat or two. \\n\\n\\nTo be honest I wad not sure I would find anything I would like/ be able to eat as I have alot of food allergies. But we had a great waiter who told me stuff I should stay away from. I went out with 6 other family members so there was alot of food that was ordered. I just ordered separately and did not try the other food.  I ordered some chicken dish that had herbs on it. It was actually pretty good. Came with rice and like roasted veggies it looked like. This restaurant is known for their at table shawarma\\ncutting thing. They have this big heater type item and you can get shawarma or other type of meat and the waiter will slice off pieces for you. It does take 25-35 min to come to the table or a little more. So if you know your table wants it I recommend placing that order first. On the other hand my cocktail I got was pretty tasty. It was called What a night! \\nWHAT A NIGHT!\\nHendrick's Gin / Basil Syrup / Lime Juice\\n\\nEveryone else at the table just shared bottles of wine. I did not have any dessert as we were all very full.\\n\\nI would recommend this place to my friends and family.\", 'Chicken Shawarma Platter 9.44/10- this portion was huge and perfect for our group to split (we had a lot leftover). The chicken was well seasoned and tender, but a bit dry. The French fries were incredibly good, the seasoning was absolutely perfect and I enjoyed how soft they were. The onions also added a lot of flavor. The pita bread on the bottom was also pretty good. Would probs get lamb next time\\n\\nBaba Ghanoush 9.65/10- normally not a huge fan of baba ghanoush, but this was so good. The texture was very creamy and velvety. There was a perfect amount of tahini and garlic in the dip, and the eggplant gave it a very decadent and smoky taste. The perfect side for the chicken platter alongside pita. I like how they also give you traditional toum, tahini sauce, and pickles. The sauces that also came with it were so good especially mixed together. \\n\\nOne of my favorite spots in NY, the service is great and the food is also fantastic and definitely an experience. Their drinks are also p strong. They offer indoor and outdoor seating.', \"Food (4/5): I got the baba ghanoush, muhamarra, halloum Mekli, mixed grill platter supreme, and rekakat jebne. All of the dishes were actually amazing. The meat on the mixed grill platter had really tender and delicious meat but the portion was smaller than expected it considering the steep price of almost $90. It had lamb, goat, chicken, shrimp, and beef. The other apps and spreads we got were really good and mixed well with the bread. It would've been great if the bread was warm though.\\n\\nService (4/5): They were helpful and took our order with no issues. The food came out at a good speed. They didn't check up on us frequently though and it took a while at the end for them to pick up our check.\\n\\nAmbiance (4/5): Unfortunately only outside seating was available when we came because they were renovating inside. The outside seating was rainproof and quite nice though. It was quite nice on the outside but stepping in to go to the restroom would've been even nicer indoors.\", \"Tangy heaven. I am Lebanese and idk I think lemon is the secret ingredient to every dish we have. Au Zatar's baba ganoosh was the best I ever had in my life hands down. It was tangy it was tender it was divine. \\n\\nThe makanek was really good. I don't know if I would get it again but I do think if you like sausage, it's a good choice. The fattet djaj was also a win. I would eat that regularly -- it's a warm and tart and creamy delight. The chicken is tender and cooked well.\\n\\nAmbiance was on the upscale end and service was amazing.\", 'Amazing food. Beautiful ambiance.  Comfy chairs. Excellent staff.

Large menu, comfortable seating. I was very hungry when I ate here and curious about some of the menu item so i ordered a meat appetizer and one of the \"casserole\" dishes. \\n\\nFor the insane price of like $42, I expected more than potatoes layered on top of thin slices of beef. However, I really enjoyed the appetizer. 3.5 stars', \"Loved this restaurant. I am originally from south Florida and were based off of what I've seen on instragram. I am so glad I went, the food was so good. I would recommend the hummus and shish tawook if you o! The frozen mint lemonade was also so delicious and refreshing. We sat at the outside heated patio, which was warm for the cold NY night.

The lamb shank was tender and juicy, if only they can cut down the salt by  1/2.  The pickles and sauces are also very salty.  Our server is super friendly and tentative.  We really appreciated his service.', \"As a frequent patron of the Au Za'atar on Avenue A, this location is lackluster in all aspects minus the decór. \\n\\nThis location has plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, and the ambiance is intimate, and cozy. The tiling is unique, there is plenty of space between tables, and is all around a large and beautiful venue. \\n\\nTo start, we ordered the fattoush salad and the muhammara dip. The salad was refreshing as always, and the muhamarra was a perfect blend of sweet and savory. \\n\\nThe rest of the experience, however, was less than unimpressive. The tableside lamb shawarma was fine; it was tender, but very dry. At $148 I would expect it to be prepared better. \\n\\nAt the other location, the waiters are extremely attentive and cut the meat for you as soon as they see that it's ready. Here, I believe our waiter only came by to cut it once. My boyfriend started cutting it himself since he thought that was the standard, but when a different waiter noticed, he rushed to us and finished the carving. This waiter also placed the knife in a safe compartment within the spinning grill, which we didn't know existed. The previous waiter just placed it on top of the platter, which, in retrospect, is a bit of a hazard considering it's a fairly large (but slightly dull) knife. \\n\\nI think that waiter was new so I give him the benefit of the doubt, but I expected better from one of my favorite restaurants. If I'm ever in midtown, I would rather find another establishment to dine, as the overall experience here was lacking.\", \"Omg RUN to this place if you're in the mood for anything remotely Mediterranean! Not only is the food itself superb, but the service and atmosphere is sophisticated and divine! We ordered a slew of items including hummus, tabbouli, rice, various meats, mahalabia, hot tea....

With so many wonderful restaurants to choose from in NYC, knowing I wouldn't get through them all in one lifetime, I'd still come back here time and time again!\", \"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. Patrizia, the manager, was incredibly kind, hospitable, and handled everything perfectly. She made us feel so welcome and cared for. Our waiter, Joshua, also did an amazing job--attentive, friendly, and professional throughout our meal. The service was excellent, and the staff made our visit truly enjoyable.

It was closed for a while and re-opened by the same owners with a somewhat more abbreviated menu.  It's a bit off the beaten path on a side street.  The space is cozy.  Our waitress was particularly excellent.  She spent a lot of time going over the menu.  I would say that Cambodian food is Thai adjacent, with some differences. We started with mango salad. It's really similar to papaya salad with a very faint mango flavor.  We also tried the excellent spring rolls.  The most interesting entree was the Ban Chao Crepe.  Really different, eaten in lettuce leaves.  The Tamarind Duck was excellent and cooked perfectly.  The Kuythiew Cha is very similar to pad Thai.  The shrimp and crabmeat fried rice was very good. \\n\\nLovely restaurant with great staff and excellent change of pace cuisine.\", \"Went here to try out Cambodian food as I haven't had it that much. The staff here were really friendly and nice. Restaurant itself had a nice vibe and was very warm as well, very essential in this NYC winter.\\n\\nI ordered the frog legs, some noodles, and pork meatballs with rice pudding dip. The dish that stood out to me the most was the frog legs, which were delicious and very peppery. The meatballs were good, and I really enjoyed the rice pudding dip which was very unique. The noodles taste similar to pad thai, and was also delicious. I recommend this place if you're looking to try your Cambodian food!\", \"If you're craving Cambodian food well you have found your spot because they are absolutely amazing!\\n\\nI got the Khmer Fish Cakes, Cumin Lamb Dumplings, Phnom Penh Roast Duck, Baked Amok (Traditional), Old fashioned pudding, and Banana Crepe.\\n\\nDepending how busy they are they could be slow or fast, but it's worth it!

The noodles tasted just as I remembered having. Also the beef and fish were perfectly cooked. They were moist, flavorful and tasty. We also ordered their spring rolls which had taro in them and were great. Vi served us and was super attentive. The ambiance was cozy with a lot of Angkor Wat inspired decor. Definitely on the more expensive side for Asian food but prices are about what you'd expect for UES.\", \"A Cambodian restaurant in UES?! Sign me up! Everything I had here was brand new to me and I absolutely loved it. \\n\\nThe Prahok Crudite was insane. It is fermented fish and pork cooked 3 ways and while all were amazing, the red curry was my favorite way.\\n\\nBaked Amok is Cambodias national dish and once again the curry and the baked fish inside had the perfect texture and depth of flavor. The whole inside rim of the container is the fish and the fat congeals in the perfect way for a ton of flavor.\\n\\nBanh Chao Crepe is an egg and turmeric crepe filled with a combination of chicken, shrimp, and pork and bean sprouts to use in lettuce wrap. The combination with the mint and lemon sauce worked perfectly. \\n\\nFor dessert we had sago. This is a hot soup with coconut milk, tapioca, and heavily salted black beans. I'm obsessed with this. It works so nicely together and the salted black beans just really work in it.\\n\\nService was amazing and helped so much figuring out what we should get to truly try some Cambodian dishes.\", 'Beautiful ambiance, amazing decor. The service was very friendly and prompt. \\n\\nThe vegetable dumplings were so good! Not your classic dumpling, they\\'re a starchy tapioca like texture, so good!\\n\\nThey have options to substitute the meat for tofu for the entrees marked with \"v\". They yellow curry was Thai flavor adjacent , but more flavorful! The spicy siem reap noodles were very similar to a drunken noodle taste. I liked the food, it was a little pricy for vegetarians unfortunately', \"Wow Bayon is a must go on the upper east side! I frequently think about the crudite. It is fermented fish & pork 3 different ways and each way was amazing! The fresh veggies really gave it a light feel as we got into our main courses. \\n\\nThe baked amok and the crepe were some of my favorite dishes I've had. Both very unique flavors. I cannot wait to go back and try some other dishes. \\n\\nOur sever was so friendly and willing to give all the suggestions!\", 'Stopped in on a whim, and was not disappointed.  The roasted duck dish was tender and flavorful, with a delicious sauce. The fish dish was superb, lots of ginger and a silky sauce that contrasted perfectly with the crispy skin of the fish.   The black bean tapioca for dessert was a delightful discovery; slightly sweet with an earthiness from the beans.', 'Food was delicious! I surprised my boyfriend with this meal for his birthday. Our favorite was the veggie dumplings. The grilled amok was easy to cut through and the curry around it was just lovely. The crepe and lamb dumplings were good. Overall a lovely evening. Price is a tad bit on the higher side but it is Manhattan.\\n\\nThe interior was clean and quiet. The lights were dimmed just enough to set the mood. The staff members were so attentive and polite! Our glasses were never empty AND they were happy to explain all the dishes to us.', \"Bayon is definitely an under recognized gem in UES and I feel so grateful to live so close to a place with great Cambodian food. I haven't had much Cambodian food before and looking at the menu I was expecting the dishes to either have a Thai or Vietnamese flavor. I was surprised by how unique the flavor profile was and the dishes really exceeded my expectations. \\n\\nWe ordered the spicy siem reap noodles with beef. At first glance it looks like Thai drunken noodles and does have a similar flavor profile, however it has less of the thai basil flavor and has something else we couldn't quite put our fingers on. The stir fried noodles weren't too heavy or greasy either which was a plus. \\n\\nWe also ordered the traditional amok, which is basically an egg soufflé with fish, scallops, and shrimp with a red curry sauce. The curry doesn't have a super strong flavor so it complements the seafood well. While the scuffle dish looks small, there was a surprising amount of seafood in there. \\n\\nPortions were reasonable and it was the perfect amount for two people. The restaurant was really quiet when we went, so it was nice to be able to pop in somewhere for dinner without needing to make a reservations super far in advance. The servers were attentive but checked in almost too frequently, trying to take our dishes away even though we were still working on it. I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!\", \"Bayon was amazing. I wasn't expecting such an authentic Cambodian experience in the UES. The owner came to our table and went through the menu with us. She properly explained everything and recommended delicious dishes. She explained that Cambodian food is influenced by Thailand and Vietnam, so I was very comfortable with each of the dishes. The dishes with Cambodian words were the more authentic dishes, so we got those. \\n\\nPrahok crudité was so good. The fermentation of dishes could be off putting for someone not used to it, but all of the preparations were so tasty. I appreciated the lettuce wraps and rice. It was such a filling appetizer. I loved that each preparation was so different. \\n\\nBanh chao crepe really reminded me of the Vietnamese version but also very distinct from it. The ingredients seemed like they were separately cooked from the crepe and put into it. There was more of a stir-fry to the ingredients. \\n\\nWe were told to get the baked amok and save the grilled amok for the next time. After having it, I can say you will want to come back for the grilled amok. A mild amount of spice. Super tasty and savory. Very reminiscent of a Thai curry, but in my opinion, less sweet. \\n\\nI loved my experience here. The food was great, and the host was very welcoming. Give it a try, and I'm certain you'll come back.\", 'Authentic and delicious Cambodian food at reasonable prices.  Hospitality is off the charts as well which is quite welcome.  Will definitely look to be back!', \"So glad that this Cambodian restaurant opened up near my work!\\n\\nMy friends and I were looking for something different than Maya's Happy hour after work, and were lucky enough to walk through the door right before the evening dinner rush. We were immediately impressed by the immaculate ambiance, with lots of wood paneling, a majestic Buddha statue, and tables set with origami flower napkins.\\n\\nI am fairly new to Cambodian food and appreciated how the spices were mild. The dishes we ordered had novel and powerful flavors. We got the Bahn Chao Crepe, Phnom Penh Roast Duck, and the Spicy Siem Reap Noodles with Beef. \\n\\nThe Bahn Chao Crepe was a chewy glutinous rice flour egg crepe filled with minced shrimp, chicken, onions, bean sprouts. The strong flavors of the filling pair well with the refreshing lettuce wrap that you top with peanut and sauce. This was an interesting dish with contrasting textures and a fun way to start the meal. The roast duck with red curry coconut sauce was also delicious. The sweetness and tenderness of the duck paired with the red coconut curry made the dish indulgent. This was best enjoyed with rice though the small bowl that accompanied the dish was not enough and we had to order another. The noodle dish was great as well, though it didn't stand out as much as the other two dishes. The sweetness of the noodle reminds me a little of Thai Pad Kee Mao although the spices and sauces used are different. \\n\\nOverall, we had a great time at this restaurant and found all the food to be outstanding. It gets busy after 6PM so try to make a reservation!\", \"I came to Bayon on a Sunday night with a few friends as I had heard great things from this UES establishment (formerly Angkor Cambodian Bistro). This was my first time trying Cambodian food and I am hooked! The dishes were incredibly flavorful and unique, and I can't wait to try more of the menu! We ordered:\\n- Fried vegetable dumplings: interesting texture made with rice flour, almost like mochi\\n- Prahok crudite: I was nervous about this one with the fermented fish but it was deliciously umami and tasty\\n- Kuythiew Cha: loved the thin rice noodles for this, perfect salty/sweet balance\\n- Bahn chao crepe: really substantial, full of meat and vegetables with fresh herbs to balance the flavors\\n- Grilled amok: perfectly cooked fish stuffed with scallops/shrimp, with a delicious creamy red curry \\n\\nThe ambiance was inviting, and the service was friendly and attentive. Would recommend for anyone seeking a unique culinary experience at one of few Cambodian restaurants in New York!\", \"First time trying out Cambodian cuisine with a group of friends. This spot was recommended by a friend and they just rebranded and reopened after COVID shut them down. Glad to see them back up and running.\\n\\nI got a cup of their Cambodian Iced Tea. Compared to the Thai Iced Tea or Vietnamese Iced Tea, it's not overly sweet with syrup. It's nicely balanced between the sweetness, the milk, and the bitterness of the coffee.\\n\\nWe started out with a few appetizers. This included Summer Rolls ($15), Steamed Dumplings ($15), Fried Vegetable Dumplings ($15), and Nem Nuong (18). The New Nuong was the most unique as well as the Fried Vegetable Dumplings.  \\n\\nFor entrees, our group split the following:\\nShrimp and Avocado Curry ($30) - A good curry dish that goes really well with white rice. The curry is super flavorful which pairs really nicely with the avocado and shrimp.\\nBanh Chao Crepe ($28) - This was very unique. Similar to JianBing or Dosa, but Cambodian style. This was loaded with shrimp, chicken, veggies, and fish sauce and it came with a bunch of stuff on the side for you to enhance the flavor even more.\\nLoc Lac ($30) - This was steak tips soaked in a black pepper-lime sauce. Taste really good, especially with white rice.\\nPhnom Penh Roast Duck ($32) - May be my favorite dish. The duck meat was great and the curry coconut sauce complements the taste. Again, goes really well with white rice.\\n\\nAlthough they didn't have a dessert menu, we were treated to Banh Januk, which was like mochi balls with a filling, and Taro Sago, which consisted of mini tapioca balls and taro in a sweet milky substance. Both were great and not overly sweet.\", \"Recently opened in February 2024, this restaurant originally opened in 2015 and served the neighborhood with distinctive cuisine until the pandemic.\\nFortunately, the owners were able to duplicate the authentic and tasteful Cambodian decor. And their food is also thankfully quite similar to the original dishes that our palates loved.\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers, the Cumin Lamb Dumplings and the Nem Nuong meatballs. Both were unlike anything we've tasted in other restaurants. The Shrimp, Crabmeat and Corn Chowder was chock full of seafood and delicately spiced. Our entrees included the Chef's Special Grilled Amok, Bahn Chao Crepe and the Spicy Siam Reap Noodles. The crepe was to be cut and rolled into the lettuce leaves ala Mu Shu style.\\nI Each dish was individually prepared to the level of seasoned that we requested.\\nServing was cheerful, friendly and prompt.\\n\\nWe highly recommend!\", \"A very tasty and unique experience in the Upper East Side! I've never eaten Cambodian food before, but I can say that my meal was culturally rich and absolutely delicious. \\n\\nSome things I noticed and loved from my service: the menu was short but clearly very intentional. Our server explained the unique dishes and how they related to Cambodia's own unique culture. The ambiance was quiet and serene, and altogether very enjoyable. \\n\\nI got the vegetable dumplings, chicken skewers, and steak tips alongside a Cambodian iced tea. I would highly recommend all of these; the vegetable dumplings were very unique, the skewers super flavorful, and my steak + friends' dishes (grilled fish and a noodle dish) were some of the best Asian food I've ever had! \\n\\nCan't stress it enough to check this place out, it's about 25-35 a person and so absolutely worth it!\", 'This place was wonderful for dinner! Tried the khmer fish cakes, spicy siem riep noodles and baked amok and everything was delicious. The combination of flavors were unlike anything I had tried before, very fresh and cozy yet not too heavy. The fried banana was also a tasty treat for dessert. Service was very attentive and well paced, unlike other places in the city that can feel rushed. The atmosphere was lovely too, not too loud.', \"The food exceeded my expectations! It was partly familiar with Southeast Asian vibes but also with new flavors I haven't had before! \\nTbh I thought their food looked alright on Yelp, but I heard good things on social media, so I still wanted to check it out!\\nThe traditional amok resembled an egg soufflé except packed with seafood in an aromatic red curry sauce. The fish and scallops were very tender and shrimp pieces were juicy. I was surprised at how fluffy the egg portion was and also much sauce was at the bottom. The curry had other types of herbs/spices that I haven't tasted in other SEA curries. \\nThe spicy siem reap noodles felt like a Thai drunken noodle, BUT it had this salted duck egg yolk taste that I couldn't really pinpoint. The beef pieces were tender, veggies crunchy, and noodles generally al dente, although I think it could have been more uniformly cooked. \\nService was pretty standard - staff were politely but checked in a little too frequently for me. The restaurant itself was big with indoor and outdoor seating in their garden. Loved how it was generally more quiet. \\nOverall I had a great time! While NYC has a lot of trendy SEA restaurants with fancy aesthetics, Bayon takes a different approach and just lets their food do the talking.\", \"Had eaten at this same location when it was formerly the Angkor Cambodian Bistro; glad to see it has re-opened, with an interior that seems fresher and brighter than in the past.  The Cumin Lamb Dumplings were pleasant to the eyes and taste, moist and able to be accompanied by a chili sauce.  The Tamarind Duck was quite sweet but tasty, though the breast meat might've been better served a little rarer.  Had been hankering for amphibious treats for a while, and the Basil Frog Legs (Cha K'dow) did not disappoint; the were plump and juicy, with a little spicy kick.\", \"Went here for a quick bite with a friend visiting and will definitely be coming back. Our service was stellar, excellent recommendations, I had the crepe and  come to this place if you're looking for something different and cute!\", 'Great food- wonderful service- great recommendations by the server as to what to (and what not) to order- a gem', \"Super cute authentic Cambodian spot. Food was AMAZING. Tried some of the most interesting southeast Asian dishes I've encountered. The owner is also SO nice and sweet and talked us through the dishes' origins and how they differ from other regions in the area. Highly recommend for any occasion, such a neighborhood gem!\", \"We had dinner here last night - wonderful friendly service and nice ambiance. I wasn't sure about the BYOB status so I bought a bottle of rose. To my surprise, $20 corkage fee. I had the lamb dumpling appetizer - six lamb meatballs in light fluffy dumplings - really more like meatballs with dough. Baked amok - nice presentation and decent flavor. My friend had shrimp and crab fried rice - crab was very fresh. Overall I was not impressed with the experience to the price point and won't be back.\", \"First off, great service! They just reopened after a closure due to Covid so they're still working out the kinks-- but you wouldn't even know it. Food was served in a timely manner that our table was almost never empty of a dish. We got iced tea, grilled amok, the crepe dish, fish cakes, and siem reap noodles (plus a bonus plate of steamed dumplings, yum!). \\n\\nThe grilled amok was stuffed with a shrimp filling and had a delicious curry sauce with a side of rice and the crepe dish was filled with pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts among other things with lettuce leaf wraps and a side of sauces and peanuts. My two favorite dishes were the fish cakes (the best side sauce with this!) and the siem reap noodles, which had just the right amount of spice to them. The iced tea is very similar to Thai iced tea. All the portions were perfectly sized where you leave feeling full and happy! \\n\\nIt was a nice quiet service with soft music and conversation going on.

I was unable to go home and see my family, so my boyfriend found this restaurant and took me here. As a Cambodian, the food here reminded me of my mom's cooking and felt very nostalgic. The food was very delicious and packed with flavor. The prahok was our favorite dish, following up with the roasted duck. On the menu, the noodles were labeled as spicy, but they weren't (the flavor was still tasty). It is very rare to stumble upon authentic Cambodian restaurants, so I would definitely stop and check this place out.

Excellent quality, fresh ingredients, truly flavorful food. We also loved the decor and relaxing and tasteful ambience. The owner came by to greet us and we learned this is the only Cambodian restaurant in nyc! The staff were attentive and friendly. Most importantly, the food was delicious. We highly enjoyed our starter, the Prahok crudite, and our mains, the duck and grilled amok were also very good.

It is a huge portion that could easily be shared. I couldn't finished 1/3 of it! That could be because I had started with the ceasar salad, which was probably one of the best I had ever had...real shaved parmesan and not too much dressing.

We ordered chicken parmesan, salmon, & a strawberry margarita. The only reason I took a star down was because the mash potatoes that came with the salmon was cold, like it was sitting on the counter. Also wasn't a huge deal, but on the menu it had single chicken Parmesan for $28 and for 2 people $48. They ended up giving us 4 single chicken parmesans, even though we ordered for 2 people for $48.

As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with a beautiful space with high ceilings and cute decor. I'm a vegetarian, and felt there were plenty of options to choose from.

The complimentary bread they gave with the main course was so tasty, especially the tomato paste-oil mixture they gave on the side!! \\n\\nThe portions for the main course were reasonable for the prices. We ordered the Capricciosia without ham and replaced the olives with onions - flavor of the pizza was great and the crust held well without being too oily either!

I really don't know where to focus on because honestly everything was great. If I had to pick some favorites, it would be the fettuccine alla bolognese, lasagna, fettucine ai pesto, and branzino. Thought the price was fair as well.\\n\\nService was great here, no complaints. Very attentive service!\\n\\nAmbience is pretty comfortable. Had a nice brick aesthetic. Tables were spaced out and the place had high ceilings with roof windows. \\n\\nOverall, really enjoyed this visit to Botte Brooklyn. Definitely worth a visit!\", \"The food was average at best. Pasta was overcooked, sauce was OK but nothing to write home about. Pizza crust, just OK. The service was horrendous, however. One waiter was working the entire floor, at least 20 tables. It was 15 minutes before he visited the table for the first time and another 15 to get my drink. Food came out fast once ordered, but similar to other comments, no offer of parmesan for the pasta, no offer for drink refills, no offer for dessert. The interior of the space was nice/pleasant, but a straight view into the working area of the kitchen was unappealing at some seats.

It was highly recommended by the hotel that I stayed at and so I decided to stop by. For starters, I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant with the warm lighting and it made me having sort of a homey good feeling which I really appreciate. The service was very well and the waiters and waitresses seem to really know their stuff. \\n\\nNow for the food... there were quite a bit of options but I felt like I wanted to go with an Italian classic, so I decided to go with the Carbonara. I'm normally a big fan of it, but unfortunately I'd have to say that it was just okay which was a little disappointing, but there's always an opportunity to come back and try other things on the menu. As for dessert I ended up getting one of my favorite desserts--Tiramisu--and my God was it heavenly. I'm disappointed that I didn't end up finishing it because of me stupidly deciding to mix wine and a Long Island ice tea, but I still savored it, and I'm glad I did. That Tiramisu really made my day I tell you, lol. Overall, I'll be back for sure.\", \"Botte is such a fun quirky italian restaurant. I first want to put out that this restaurant has amazing service! The manager Vinny is so kind, attentive, and fun! He constantly check on us and told us a little bit about the history of Botte which was so nice to hear! \\n\\nNow. For the food! Appetizers were out of this world! We got the Calamari and the Salmon Tartare! Both were so delicious and filling. For our mains I got the Margherita pizza, my friends got the fettuccine al pesto and pasta alla vodka. I thought my pizza was okay. I think I didn't like the crust that they used and cheese, but it was alright! My friend loved the fettuccine al pesto! She thought it was savory and well cooked. For the Pasta alla vodka it was also really good, but a little salty. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the teramisu and a cannoli. Teramisu was fantastic and moist! I've never had a cannoli, so I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't a big fan of it, but I think it's because I didn't like the texture of the filling. \\n\\nOverall a really good place! I'll definitely be back to try out some of the pasta, but I do recommend you to come and visit this location!\", \"Went with a group of 23 to have our carb dinner before the Brooklyn half marathon.

The spaghetti was a bit too overcooked for me but still tasty. I added chicken and the service size was pretty small. The garlic bread was good but VERY garlicy. The truffle fries weren't the greatest as they just tasted like plain potatoes. Everyone else had pretty good feedback on their dishes.\", 'Ordered online and came over for pickup. the arugula and Pear salad was amazing. pasta with the guanciale!! omg fantastic. Garlic bread was aight', 'Delicious Pizza ! Calamari taste so fresh. The service is quick. Staff are kind and polite, very friendly. Inside the restaurant is very beautiful! If you were nearby check it out. Thanks for the service!', 'My boss took me out to lunch for a \"new employee\" lunch to Botte Brooklyn so you can imagine how weird it was for me to take a picture of my plate for this review but she understood the assignment! It wasn\\'t too busy at lunch time probably because it was on a weekday.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my food. I knew I wanted something creamy but couldn\\'t decide on what to get so my waiter suggested the Rigatoni Al 4 Formaggi which tasted really good. I wish there was more of a serving though. \\n\\nMy waiter was really nice and kinda cute lol I also fancied the decor inside as well. The location itself is very convenient to get to and easily accessible by train. I\\'d definitely recommend if you\\'re looking for a lowkey spot for good Italian food.', 'Perfect happy hour with mini burgers and cocktails. A good deal and great vibe and service.', \"On a Friday evening before catching a show a friend and I came to Botte to grab dinner. Botte stood out to us because of its exposed brick interior and large menu. Also, my friend is very picky about anything spicy so Italian it was. We arrived right on time for our reservation and was happy to find out that it was still happy hour. The restaurant's bar was pretty full and the main dining area was pretty empty. \\n\\nWe were happy to see that the Happy Hour menu included espresso martini's, fried mozzarella and suppli (rice balls) so we started with that. The espresso martini was delicious and filled to the brim ... maybe even a little higher lol. Our waiter struggled to get it over to the table but did a much better job then I could ever. The fried mozzarella included 2 small squares, one of which the cheese had melted out of the breading and unfortunately when they got to us they were pretty cold, so no cheese :/ Either way the fried mozzarella lacked flavor. The suppli was by far the best and was piping hot when we received it, would definitely recommend this if you go. \\n\\nOnto the entrees, I got the spaghetti alla carbonara and my friend got spaghetti alla vodka with chicken. We both weren't too impressed with our dishes because they lacked flavor. The portion size however was the perfect amount. Also the additional chicken my friend got was the tiniest portion. We could barely find it amongst the pasta. \\n\\nThe service overall was ok. We had to remind our waiter a couple of times about things they'd forgotten. Overall, while the interior is great for photo ops and the espresso martini was good, I don't think that I would come back to Botte.\", \"The food was absolutely impeccable and came very quick. The salad didn't come out before the mains so the manager gave us gelato and orangcello shots on the house (which was so not necessary). The staff is so kind, the vibe is so cute, feels like a vintage warehouse, full of antique italian posters. \\n\\nWill definitely be coming back here - great experience!\", 'Great food and atmosphere. Would recommend getting one of the pastas. The 4 cheese pasta was delicious', \"When nearby places are having long waits and no reservations, this was a great find. Sharped dressed servers greeted us immediately and welcomed us warmly. We ate late and still had great service. The specials sounded amazing, but once I saw the brick oven, I was down for pizza. Perfectly crispy crust with mushrooms and truffle oil on mozzarella. The flavors were so simple and perfectly balanced. I was sad when it was over. My wife had rigatoni with vodka sauce, and again- so balanced with great flavor. It was deeply rustic and delicious. The ingredients were clearly fresh and the prices were reasonable for good portions. \\n\\nOh and the vibe inside was very nice. Warm, creative, inviting, cozy, without feeling like I was dining with the table next to me. \\nWhen we're back in Brooklyn, we'll be back!\", \"Walked in, and the hostess was very kind and able to rearrange some reservations to fit us, party of 3, for dinner. My impression upon walking is that this restaurant was very fun and could be a great date spot!\\n\\nOur waiter was fine but clearly overwhelmed that night. It was a busy restaurant with only 2, maybe 3 waiters/waitresses working. My biggest feedback was that the food was very salty. All of our appetizers and actual dishes were very salty making it hard to eat. When we mentioned that to our waiter, he just disregarded our concerns and said that's how it's supposed to be, which was surprising. Furthermore, the foccia appeared more like a pita bread than a focaccia. Very thin, tough, and with lots of oregano; not fluffy at all. \\n\\nFor the price that we paid, the food was fine but I was hoping for better\", 'Nice place great service a little pricey but over all good. Easy to walk to from close by hotels', \"Came here for brunch a few weeks ago after searching for nice Italian near/around Downtown Brooklyn.  Botte came up and I love trying new spots so some friends and family came here.  What a treat!  This place is such a hidden gem.\\n\\nIt's not that easy to find this place. You can easily get to it by the many buses and trains that take you to Dekalb/Flatbush/Fulton, but it's a few blocks away from there. Kind of in the middle of no other businesses.  Easy to miss!  We were very warmly greeted by the lovely hostess.  The decor screams so many things.  It's classy, rustic, old-school...I know it sounds weird, but I get many vibes from it and that's not a bad thing!  The bar is to the left and the white and black old-school tiles give it such a homey feeling.  We had a reservation for 6 and we were seated promptly. We started with drinks.  I had the Passione.  That was Prosecco and Passion Fruit purée.  That was so good and heavy on the Prosecco so I was feeling good!  For an appetizer, I split the Bruschetta Fichi E Ricotta.  It was caramelized figs, red wine reduction, and ricotta over toasted bread. So fresh and tasty!  Everyone else at my table decided to get the pizzas. That seemed to be what all the patrons at this establishment were getting!  I wasn't in the mood for pizza for brunch so I just go the vegetable omelet.  Onions, peppers, mushrooms, and spinach.  Came with fingerling potatoes and mixed greens.  When the pizzas came out, my mom and I were so disappointed that we didn't get one!  They looked AMAZING and my friends loved them.  GREAT size for one person at a reasonable price.  My omelet was only $15 and the drink was $10.  You could get a pitcher of brunch drinks for only $32.  For such a simple brunch item, my eggs were perfectly cooked and everything tasted off the charts!  So satisfying.  They don't have a dessert menu, but they do have dessert specials. I got the Pannacotta.  Very good, not too heavy.  I enjoyed it.\\n\\nI recommend everyone try Botte!  Such attentive service, good food, and a great atmosphere with prices that won't break the bank. I'll be back!\", 'The vibes are cute & what you would expect for this location. The bolognese was tasty, but nothing extra special in my opinion.', 'Great drinks!! Must try! Great service! Very nice spot to catch happy hour! Great Expresso Martini!', 'Beautiful interior, amazing food with good prices especially in the city! Everything tasted amazing and was brought out quickly. Great service! Cannot recommend enough.', \"They brought good bread to the table. I only wish it was warm but it was hood and the olive oil was great, very fruity. We ordered from. The restaurant week menu but also hot some additional appetizers. We started with a buratta and the beef carappcio (thinly diced raw beef). Both were delicious. The buratta was creamy, cold and fresh. The beef was very thinly sliced and melted away quickly. The only wish we had is that there was less greens or no greens on the items. They got in the way and were getting caught on our throats. \\nThe rice balls were crispy and very cheesy. They were lightly flavored and came with a tasty tangy red sauce. The calamari was very good as well. It was fried well and had a good chew. Both of these were from the restaurant week menu. By the time our mains arrived we were very full. I will say visually the chicken milanese looked better than the chicken parm. I didn't like how the mozerella looked on it. The milanese was also crispier.\\nThe appetizers were delicious and we ate very well. We took a bite of our mains but being full we went to dessert. Dessert was okay. The mouse was very decadent and was dark chocolate. It came with ice cream. The cannoli was fine but the cream was gritty which is normal for canoli.  I definitely recommend this place and although we ordered from the restaurant week menu they were very generous with the portions they gave us. They didn't skimp on anything. Our waiter was great too.\", '- delicious grilled shrimp\\n- good spaghetti\\n- a lot more packed than i would expect on a weekday lunch\\n- service could be better\\n- Caesar salad was good and large enough for two people\\n- bread was nice and soft\\n  not warm\\n  they gave olive oil, no vinegar, no butter\\n- roasted potatoes are good\\n- salmon is decent', \"I have been here a few times and each and every time that I have gone the staff has been personable and knowledgeable.

But the rest of my meal was the specials, the spaghetti allá pescatora and the scallops with asparagus, Brussels sprouts and aioli. The spaghetti was highly\\nrecommended by my waiter since it was on the normal menu and was brought back due to popular demand.  The scallops were just because I want scallops. If it wasn't for the specials I would have tried the carbonara (they use guanciale) or the spaghetti vongole \\nThe meals was good. The scallops were tendered and the pasta had the right amount of light tomato sauce as promised by the waiter with good amounts of seafood.\\nI would definitely come back especially for happy hour since it came highly recommended and the brunch as well!

I would come back because the food was so good.\", 'Given the name, \"The Reading Room,\" I thought it\\'d have a cozier ambience. Upon entering, we saw a lot of suits, which gave it a stiffer atmosphere than expected. There were some books placed high on some shelves, but nothing about the place made me think of a reading room. The place is small, and all tables were full. We had a reservation so no concern there.\\n\\nSince many of items on the menu sounded appetizing, it was hard to decide. Three appealing  fish dishes were offered. I love bone marrow so contemplated getting that. But since it only had one bone marrow piece, I opted for the beet salad and the hanger steak with fries. My husband wasn\\'t very hungry so he ordered two appetizers: the grilled octopus and steak on toast. \\n\\nMy beet salad came out with my husband\\'s grilled octopus. My salad was a moderate portion with frisée, arugula and what looked like a medium sized beet sliced up. I was expecting more beets since it is highlighted in the salad name. But it was more like a small supporting role than the star. The goat cheese added a nice balance to the red wine vinaigrette, taming the acidity. It seems they were out of the red currants and replaced it with golden raisins. And I didn\\'t taste any fennel.\\n\\nMy husband\\'s grilled octopus was prepared well. The octopus was tender, not overcooked, and it was served with a creamy hummus. I didn\\'t see parsnips, but it had some roasted green beans.  Fried sweet potato chips added a subtle sweetness to the dish and a nice bit of crunchy texture. \\n\\nWhile we sat there, several tables changed over. After our first dishes, we found ourselves waiting for some time before my main dish and husband\\'s second appetizer came out. Considering the place doesn\\'t hold many tables, I was puzzled as to why it was taking so long. Then a table of five that had arrived after we did ended up getting all of their main plates before we did. Our waitress said she\\'d look into our orders. When our orders finally did arrive, my plate looked good. But unfortunately, my hangar steak was cooked medium to medium well instead of the medium rare I had asked for. The fries were ok; not the style I prefer. They were similar in type to the fries served at five guys. They weren\\'t bad fries, just not my preferred style.  The chimichurri sauce was surprisingly a nice addition to the steak. I usually don\\'t like any sauce on my steak, and I was worried that it may be slathered on. But it wasn\\'t drenched in it and it wasn\\'t overpowering. \\n\\nThe steak was also tepid. It was almost as if the plates were pushed to the side and forgotten in a corner. Being that we had already waited too long for our plates, I just ate it as it came (we also had our daughter waiting for us to join her after dinner). A few minutes after we finally got our plates, another table of five that arrived much later than we did received all of their plates, too. \\n\\nMy husband\\'s steak on toast was tasty. The steak slices were on top of arugula with a complimenting chimichurri sauce. \\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate I could only give three stars. But with the long wait for the food and incorrect handling of the steak, that\\'s all I could give. The flavors were pretty good for the dishes, but the execution needs to be improved.', \"Great food and atmosphere. Cute dimly lit restaurant on the first floor of a hotel. Staff was attentive. For drinks, got the penicillin which was delicious and highly recommended if you like whiskey sours or similar drinks.\\n\\nAppetizer was the grilled octopus. The octopus and hummus worked so well together!\\n\\nThe entree was the ribeye for two. Delicious and would order again. The ribeye for two is one big ribeye. It is not the best ribeye I've ever had but very good nevertheless. It also came with mashed potatoes and broccolini. The broccolini was a bit undercooked, but tasted amazing as well. The mashed potatoes were creamy!\\n\\nOverall, not the best food ever, but definitely great for the value in the area.\", 'Weird vibe here. Old world resto in a brand new hotel. Food was ok but like a thousand other places in NY.', \"Second time visiting NYC this year, came back to try Reading Room again, this time with my daughter that lives in Manhattan. Great entrees - short rib and filet mignon - but the mashed potatoes with the filet were listed on the menu as 'garlic' and didn't have a hint of garlic. The bone marrow appetizer came with almost zero bone marrow so we basically ate a lot of dry, grilled toast. The sorbet selection could use some changes: the passionfruit and watermelon are way too close in flavor and could not be differentiated; the pineapple sorbet was too chunky. Still, the mains were quite good, and cooked righteously well. Service is good and the atmosphere is quality. Would give it a third try and try the mussels instead.\", \"A small and intimate setting was perfect to meet up with some old friends. Great for conversation while you ate because it wasn't excessively loud.\\n\\nWe arrived for our 5 pm reservation and was greeted and seated promptly. Service was very good, timely and attentive. I started with the meat board which was huge and had quite an array of cheeses and salame. Our table was quite impressed and it lived up to its appearance...delicious. My friends had the steak tartar and said it excellent.\\n\\nFor entrée I had that steak frite...superb. Grilled just as ordered. My wife had the gnocchi which she said was great. My friends used the word 'outstanding' when describing their burgers.\\n\\nFoe dessert we shared a chocolate flourless torte.

It's actually inside the Gotham Hotel, relaxing vibe and dim lights. Definitely get cocktails! My friend had the Fireside that comes with actual smoke and was tasty. Rosemary Baby has blackberries and rosemary and tequila, delicious. Penicillin drink was definitely different and interesting. I asked for bread and butter (not sure if it's just automatically brought out ) but it was delicious grilled bread. The Beet Tar Tar app was cold beets with a tasty citrus flavor and really refreshing for summer. My friend had the Octopus app which had a great sauce under it .He got the Steak Frites with Chimichuri sauce (he asked for on the side) and he really enjoyed that. My salmon had baby beets and a citrus salad. Good. Someone in the kitchen really cares . Food was tasty . Staff including bartender and waitress were both really nice . They brought out free dessert with a candle ! Sidenote..... this is near Grand Central and probably gets mostly out of towners but don't be put off by that ....we are locals and had a great time. 70s rock was playing but wasn't too loud.

I googled places, other than a diner, and happened upon this jewel.  It's in the Gotham Hotel and is designed like a library.  We order the pancakes which were delicious with a nice crust on the edges plus a blueberry compote on the side.  The eggs and sausage added a nice full meal\\n\\nAll the wait staff was excellent as well - so pleasant and accommodating - make us feel very welcomed.

The food and drink options were everything you may want and more for an event, and the price was lower than virtually any other option in the area.\\n\\nI cannot recommend The Reading Room enough, especially for large parties and corporate events.', 'Food was very good.  Had pancakes with blueberry compote. Friends were very happy with their food as well. Service was not super great.

Once you get there though it's a nice little quiet find. I was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance. It's definitely very nice for a couple drinks or a light dinner. The servers were very nice throughout the meal and checked in often. Will go back to explore the rest of the drinks menu\", 'Simply amazing. We found this place through Yelp as it was near our hotel. When we arrived in town, it was a brief 6 minute walk. The place was fairly empty for 8:30pm on a Friday, but we grabbed a table because all of these reviews couldn\\'t be wrong! Indeed, they were not. \\n\\nWe started with cocktails. I had the \"Tristessa\", which is one of, if not the best, cocktail I\\'ve ever had. I loved it so much, I had two.

We drove out to NYC for a day to take the little guy to a museum and to see the Xmas tree and lights at the Rockefeller Center. This was his first time seeing the NYC holiday decor so we were pretty excited to take him.\\n\\nWhat we didn't plan for was not being able to walk-in to a restaurant for dinner because of them all being fully booked. In hindsight, I'm not surprised but as we walked from restaurant to restaurant being denied entry because we didn't have a reservation, our hangry party wasn't very happy. To add salt to the wounds, it began pouring rain. So we stood under the awning of a booked restaurant while I called places to find one that might accommodate us. \\n\\nWhen I called the Reading Room I was greeted by a very friendly woman who was sympathetic to our struggle. The restaurant was fully booked as well but there was one table available for another hour and 15 minutes if we could be done within that time. We were right around the corner so of course we accepted and were SO GRATEFUL!\\n\\nThe kitchen hadn't been open when I called but I was told they got it started so we could order right away. \\n\\nEveryone was so friendly and kind and the three of us, including our hungry, grumpy 4 year old were thankful. \\n\\nOn top of the wonderful service we received, the food was great! The cocktails we had were so refreshing. The octopus starter was well-cooked and delicious. I shared the Peri Peri chicken with my son and my husband had the seafood stew. Everything was great!\\n\\nI'd like to thank the staff working that night for accommodating us for dinner. We appreciate your kindness! And I'm glad we ended up there because now we found another great restaurant :)\", 'Food, portion and price were aligned. Good business lunch spot in midtown. You need to walk past the hotel lobby toward the rear.', 'A cozy little spot for a delicious steak. The ribeye is really tender. The cocktails are decent. The ambiance is dim and romantic.', \"Came here as an alternative to nearby, hyped post-work bars upon a friend's recommendation.  Was surprised to see it in a hotel but at least it was right back through the doors.  Atmosphere was popping in a good way, and the decor was classy without going overkill.  Bartenders were serious but also friendly, which is a rare combo in this kind of place.  Prices were what you'd expect; really hate the $15-$20 drink trend but you're not avoiding it in Midtown if you want to be somewhere that's not a dive bar (and even then).\\n\\nNot sure what I was thinking getting the Fireside (Old Overholt Rye, Cherry Heering, Antica, Cherry Bark Vanilla Bitters).  As the name and ingredient list would suggest, this was a smoked cocktail with a ton of booze.  Perfect for a winter evening, not a summer one.  It was well executed with the bitter cherry flavors being a highlight though.  The Jungle Bird made up for my mistake (Blackstrap Rum, Pineapple Juice, Simple, Lime Juice, Passion Fruit Float).  Perfect pineapple and rum cocktail which is generous on the rum.  I could've sat there and drunk those all night.\\n\\nGood alternative to the Campbell if you're by Grand Central.  Some hotel bars are stuffy with a weird atmosphere, however this was a nice exception.  Would come again.\", \"What a sweet surprise here!

Everything is reasonably priced and the staff take good care of you quick in and out. \\n\\nMy recommendation would get the Carne Asada or El Pasor quesadilla which is basically a flour taco with melted white cheese and your choice of meat with cilantro, onions, and lettuce.

We ordered the pollo asado and the adobada tacos on corn tortillas, and both were so delicious and so flavorful. The chicken taco was my personal favorite and was honestly one of the best tacos I've ever had. The pork taco was also super delicious but a bit more sweet and meaty.

It was well worth the $6, but for the same price I would have normally gotten 2-3 tacos. \\n\\nAgain, this meal was a great treat just not a full meal for a fatboy like myself.

I did wish he was more proactive about providing menu recommendations. We ended up googling and yelping ourselves. \\n\\nI can't give this a 5* mostly due to the food quality. \\n\\nWe ordered PCT, clam conserva, croquette, grilled octopus, pork loin, and wild red shrimp \\nTheir bread and garlic is good, so anything with those elements is quite solid. \\n\\nPCT was my fave. Idk what PCT stands for or its meaning in Spanish, but it's basicallly tomato puree on bread. It looks simple but still tasted so good. Garlic was strong. The tomato was juicy without being too wet. \\n\\nCroquettes are flavor of the day. It was ham when we went. It was alright nothing special. It came out fresh and crunchy without being too hard. I forgot what was inside but it helped balance the salty ham. \\n\\nClam conserva wasn't what we expected it to be. Jk I googled beforehand too. I'm wondering what's the cultural meaning behind eating directly from the can. We were pleased it wasn't fishy or salty coming out of a can. It came with bread so by default it tastes good. There were a lot of clams in that can. \\n\\nGrilled octopus was a bit disappointing. We couldn't find it at first since the online menu mentioned it coming with black rice. Now it's octopus over potatoes. I found the octopus not tender enough. We didn't like the flavor. The potatoes were bland but it kinda worked out to balance out the pork loin later. \\n\\nWild shrimp was fighting with octopus for the worst spot. We didn't realize beforehand the shrimp came with head and shell. It had a lot of garlic and oil which tasted good but the problem was with the shrimp. It was too mushy which was another issue when we had to peel the shell. I think I read other people on Yelp say it's not fresh either. \\nAlso dislike how they didn't clean the intestines here. It was very thick and dark. \\n\\nPork loin was a bit too salty in the beginning, but then I think we got used to it and like the sauce. The edge pieces were a bit dry but the insides were quite tender. The scallion on the side was huge and we had trouble cutting it so skipped out on it. \\n\\nWe weren't full full at the end but all the bread and oil and butter made us satisfied. I actually felt full after drinking another cup of water. We were joking their tap water tastes better than normal. Perhaps it's because of all the strong flavors in their dishes. \\n\\nTheir kitchen is an open kitchen just behind the counter. I don't recall smelling anything upon arrival or my clothes being smelly after leaving. Ventilation is so important.  \\n\\nTheir bathroom is a hallway of 4-5 individual rooms with sinks inside. I like that format. The sinks are so deep. It's probably deeper than my forearm is long. Imagine dropping something in there.\", \"A very cute space that fits the restaurants name Debajo - you follow the stairs outside that lead you downstairs to this cozy oasis!\\n\\nOf the tapas, I particularly enjoyed the Grilled Octopus and the Little Gem Salad - the refreshing crunch was just what I needed. I've wanted to try the octopus with the forbidden rice but it was not available that day.\", 'The place is nice and comfortable. It has a modern look. The service is ok. The staff know the food and they are attentive. The food is \"ok\". Perhaps I am picky because I know Spanish food. I know some of the dishes are just canned even though they could actually make them by themselves (as they do in most spanish bars). I thought the chistos would actually be the sausage, but it\\'s more like little hotdogs! The best dishes: the octopus is good (I wonder if they buy the octopus raw and cook there - I didn\\'t ask). The patatas bravas were good. The shrimp were good. The cauliflower was tasty but it was not really a Spanish dish. I\\'ve stayed away from Spanish food in NYC so I can\\'t compare but it is inferior to at least most bars in Spain.', \"Food was reasonably good, but even for an exorbitant tapas place the portion sizes were inane.\\n\\nLiterally 15$ for 5 pepperoni pieces of Chorizo. If it wouldn't have destroyed the social vibe I would've sent it back in disbelief.\\n\\nAnother 15-20$ for a few slices of cheese and 10 almonds. I don't understand the reviews here. Service average.\", \"Food has good flavors but I think it was due to them just opening & not even staff that the service was very slow, they did apologize & comped the salmon along with giving another croquette dish, so nice of them and really appreciated it!  It is pricey for these tapas but I did enjoy them, I would say the duck was salty but the ham croquettes, octopus, salmon, potatoes bravas was good.  It's located downstairs from a hotel, nice speakeasy decor.  I'll come back again for another try!\", \"Delicious and fresh Spanish food tucked away in a downstairs restaurant. Service was decent and the food was a real throwback to Madrid. The waiter recommended 2-3 tapas per person and 1 main to share for every 2 people, so we ended up getting the Patatas Bravas, Cauliflower, Brussels, Olive + Sardines, Tomato Bread, Jamon, Octopus and Babette Steak. I'm pescatarian so couldn't eat Jamon or Steak but my favourites from the rest were the Olives and Tomato Bread. Patatas were a bit too saucy for me so the potatoes were no longer crisp. Cauliflower and brussels tasted a bit Chinese which was unexpected.\\n\\nI also looooved the desserts and thought they were the highlights - lava cake and panna cotta were both absolutely amazing. They sound like relatively simple dishes but were some of the best I've had!! Panna cotta was the perfect texture and the lava cake was so chocolately and gooey. We also got a pitcher of Sangria which totaled around 5-6 glasses and was good, not too sweet.\", \"The food and service here is great, just a little pricey for tapas. My favorites from what my friend and I ordered were the patatas bravas ($16 for a good portion - loved the sauce) and pulpo rice ($29 for an appetizer portion). \\n\\nNot sure if I'd return given the price point but the food is delicious, just a little expensive if you're ordering multiple tapas to be full.\", 'Debajo is really so underrated, and I hope that more people discover it for themselves! We came on a Friday evening as a large group for a corporate dinner, and were extremely well looked after the entire evening (huge shoutout to Ross!). From always ensuring our drinks were topped up, to checking in just the perfect number of times without being overbearing, the entire evening was made that much better by just being at Debajo. \\n\\nThe food was also absolutely delectable, and actually so great for sharing. Since we were a larger group, we did get to try a variety of the items on the menu. The duck was surprisingly the group favourite, which paired with a light and refreshing kale salad. With that said though, the gambas, charcuterie board, cauliflower, potatoes, rice, and more were pretty much all cleared from the plates. Towards the end as we were also sharing some desserts, we were given an additional item on the house because the team were worried the number of desserts shared were not enough! So so sweet.\\n\\nI would highly recommend Debajo to anyone in the area, and also those not - it is well worth the trek. The moody lights, not so crowded spacing indoors, and lowkey décor is a must for anyone looking for a tapas spot.', 'Ooooh my goodness this is my new favorite place for tapas. This honestly is better than other places I\\'ve been too -- namely the chain \"Barcelona.\" I think it\\'s cute it\\'s named \"Debajo\" since it is technically below (you walk down some stairs to access it). I made a reservation on Seated, and they didn\\'t have it in their system, but thankfully there were empty tables so we were able to get seated quickly!\\n\\nThe menu is somewhat small but definitely mighty. I loved the Albariño we had -- super refreshing and paired nicely with all the dishes we got. For two people, we ordered these dishes (and we ended up having leftovers):\\n\\n1. P-C-T: 5/5 Soooo good. Such a nice portion too! The spread was amazing.\\n2. Patatas Bravas: 5/5 Also the best patatas bravas I have had compared to other tapas places. These were fried so nicely.\\n3. Cod Croquetas: 5/5 Maybe my second favorite after the P-C-T. This almost reminded me of the Filet O\\' Fish sandwich from McDonald\\'s (in a good way).\\n4. Pulpo Rice: 4/5 I do feel like the price was a little steep for the portion size, but the octopus was delicious. \\n5. Charred Broccolini: 4/5 I loved the surprise of the citrus in this dish! It might have been mandarin oranges they included and they worked SO well in this dish.\\n\\nI would absolutely love to come back!!!', \"High quality Spanish tapas in a cool underground kind of setting.\\n\\nPaleta Iberico ($19) - These thin slices of 36 month aged ham were pretty tasty although slightly too salty for my taste. The menu said this came with pickles although it actually came with pickled cauliflower rather than traditional pickles (not necessarily a bad thing).\\n\\nChistos ($14) - This plate of 12 little crispy sausage rolls was actually my favorite of the three tapas we ordered, as the outside was nice and crispy and the sausages were cooked well. Each roll was a nice bite sized amount.\\n\\nGambas al Ajillo ($20) - This dish of garlic shrimp seems to be a favorite of diners here. While it was good, it was kind of swimming in oil and I didn't find it to be particularly special.\\n\\nBurnt Basque Cheesecake ($11) - A nice, soft, and tasty cheesecake with yummy strawberry compote on top. Slightly small portion size though.\\n\\nThe environment is quite interesting, as the restaurant is actually below the sidewalk level (you can either take an elevator down or go down the stairs from the sidewalk). As such, it can be easy to miss this place, although there is a little sign by the sidewalk. But this does give the place a bit of a hidden, special kind of vibe. The decor of the place is a mix between modern and traditional Spanish style. There is a bit of an elevated and intimate kind of vibe. We were able to walk in and get a table without a wait on a Friday night. The staff were friendly and fairly attentive. The service speed was decent.\\n\\nOverall, while these tapas were pretty good, I thought they were slightly overpriced. That being said, the nice and unique environment can substantiate the value a bit, so I would still give Debajo a solid 4 stars.\", 'Excellent Spanish tapas in a beautiful basement space. Service was quick and friendly. Highly recommend the cauliflower and broccoli as well as the cod croquettes. The pork chop with trumpet mushrooms were delicious, but also very rich.', 'Loved the food here. PCT, patatas bravas and definitelyyy the croquettas were our favorites. Basque cheesecake shocked us with how good it was, and churros were delightfully light and fluffy. Appreciated the cozy restaurant vibes seated at a corner booth table near the window and friendly staff.', 'Great spot for a date or intimate group dinner! The octopus was so well done and I was depressed that we had to leave steak on the table bc the portion sizes were fairly generous for a midtown tapas spot. This is an establishment that wants you to have wine to pair with your courses and you should really take their lead on that one. 10/10 would come back!', \"Debajo is an intimate bar and tapas restaurant situated in the Made hotel. \\n\\nI came on a Monday night with friends. There weren't many people other than a small group celebrating a birthday by the bar. We tried to sit on the couches but they were reserved for the night. \\n\\nWe ordered the PCT, patatas bravas, and some drinks. The PCT was delicious, I enjoyed the tangy tomatoes on the sourdough bread. The hint of olive oil was fantastic. The patatas bravas was fantastic as well, so we ordered another. Unfortunately, the second bowl that came out had a piece of hair in it. The waiter replaced it after we expressed our concern. \\n\\nI wish we could've been seated in the couches that were unoccupied the entire night. Other than that, the ambiance and the food made for a great experience.\", \"We were excited to try this place but ultimately a bit disappointed.\\n\\nThe cauliflower, mini hot dog rolls, and little gem salad weren't bad (I thought very good bar food) but we weren't huge fans of anything else - the patatas bravas were too soft and soggy and the shrimp which came highly recommended by the waiter was too oily and lacked flavor. A small point but most tables are high top chairs, some without any backs, which I found a little uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf you want just a few small bites, like the cauliflower and mini hot dog rolls, probably ok but otherwise not sure I would return for dinner.\", \"We ordered 4 small plates and a dessert to share. My favorite from what we ordered was patatas bravas and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts had the spicy kick that I was looking for. Also loved the chocolate sorbet with olive oil. The dark chocolate was so rich in flavor and it's the perfect level of sweetness.\\n\\nThey were also generous in the alcohol department. We had some really strong cocktails.\\n\\nThe service was really nice. The staff was very attentive without making us feel like they want to get rid of us as soon as we finished our dessert.\\n\\nLovely and intimate ambiance. It felt trendy, but not pretentious.\", \"Came here on a Sat night with a reservation for 2. You have to enter through the hotel/cafe door as the outside door was locked after us trying to go down the stairs. \\n\\nThe space is very tight. They have about 5-6 2 person tables, a long communal table, and a couple of 4 seaters along with the bar. Then there's the outdoor space with a heater. We decided to sit in the middle so there was more space than being crammed along with a crowd of people over in 1 area where all the 2 seaters were. I had hung my jacket and purse behind my seat and throughout the service the wait staff kept knocking into my jacket and purse. They asked me to put it under the hooks of the table which I didn't notice, but that didn't stop them from nudging me every time they walked by.\\n\\nFor food, the menu goes from small tapas to larger portion plates top to bottom. They had a few specials for the day as well. We tried the calmari, cod croquettes, brocollini, steak, and patatas bravas. Everything was nicely made. I don't think anything particularly stood out to me. The steak comes with a side salad, but the potatoes in them didn't really add cohesion imo. \\n\\nOverall, a good meal. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. And the food comes out fast if your short on time.\", \"Out of the several highly rated Spanish restaurants I've tried around the city, Debajo was underwhelming. My friend and I got Cod Croquetas, Romanesco Cauliflower, and Pulpo Rice. \\n\\nWe both agreed the cauliflower dish was the best. It tasted like Lao Gan Ma sauce, so almost an Asian fusion dish? I liked the flavor and found it roasted perfectly--not too crunchy nor tender. As for the croquetas, these were a miss for me. I wasn't a fan of their mushiness and would've preferred the texture of fish meat rather than mashed fish. Lastly, the pulpo rice was just ok. They do serve a good amount of octopus, so they're not skimping, but it just wasn't memorable.\\n\\nAll in all, I would not mind returning, and I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant, but my friend said she probably would not come back.\", \"I always walked by this place and thought I would finally try it with my friends but we left hungry and disappointed... We get that it is basically tapas here, but the portion sizes were so small and each dishes were so overpriced... I came with a party of five and we legit had two bites of each dish and were overwhelmed to order more b/c our bill was already high..\\n\\nI found nothing special with any of the dishes to justify their price either. \\n\\nAmbiance is definitely cute and it wasn't as packed when we went on a Thursday night for dinner, but the cocktails were also just so-so.\", \"This is a hidden tapas bar in Nomad. When I saw hidden, I mean you will be lost trying to find this place. Even with google maps, the address, it is hard to figure out where you are. It's in the basement of the Made Hotel.\\n\\nTapas are absolutely delicious, but yes they can get super pricey. To be honest, the quality you're getting I would give 4 stars. It's just that the price of some of these dishes is very over the top. I would recommend the Cod croquettes. Absolutely sinful!\\n\\nIG: @QueenOfAdventureNYC\", \"If you are around the area and want small tapas, this is the place to go. The decor is so simple and classy. The vibe is chill, intimate and romantic. \\nMy friends and I ordered shrimp, octopus rice, sausage rolls, cauliflower and steak (refer to the pics for their official names per menu). Everything tastes fabulous. My favorites are the cauliflower and steak. Cauliflower mixed with breadcrumbs in spicy flavor (with chili crisp) and a bit add on lemon. Multiple flavors at the same moment in the mouth just blow my mind. For the steak plate, the highlight is the kales under the meat. It mixed with mustard vinegar which creates the refreshing sense after the bite of the juicy steak. Love it! \\nIn terms of the drink, I got Flor De Jerez which mainly made of Barbados rum. It was a bit sweet to me, not like typical cocktail. \\nOne thing you need to keep in mind is that the tips  automatically calculated starting from 20%. Also, they calculate the tips based on the amounts after sales tax which is wrong. So you better do your own calculation to pay the tips you feel worthy and based on the subtotal not including the sales tax.\\nOverall, it was a nice experience so we didn't bother ourselves too much about the overpaid tips.\", 'We came here for a quick dinner and a few drinks. It is a cute small place with perfectly dim lighting that is well suited for a tranquil gathering with family and or friends. Very spacious with table seating and bar seating. We ordered a salad and a shrimp dish and a few beers. We were greeted and served in a timely manner.', 'This place is amazing. The food is unreal and the atmosphere is so cozy. You would never know you were in the heart of midtown with how relaxing and warm it is. The staff is very friendly. A hidden gem!', \"Really enjoyed this hidden little tapas spot in nomad. Very small menu, more of an after work drink + snacks type of place vs. full on dinner. PALETA IBERICO was really good and they didn't skimp on the serving. The anchovies was prob the other standout dish. Worth a quick stop for casual drink, return visit - but more because it's in my neighborhood vs. anything else.  \\n\\nFood: 6/10\\nValue: 7/10\\nService: 6/10\\nVibe: 7/10\", 'Venue is quiet and quaint. Little pricey for the portions but worth it for the ambiance.', 'Loved the vibe - great place to hang out for drinks and tapas with friends OR for a date (comfortable low key space and flattering lighting).  The relaxing vibe did remind me of Spain a little.\\n\\nPlace is in the basement.  Food was good - no complaints.  Maybe other than I sort of wish they had padron peppers instead of shishito (always 1/10 chance of winning the spicy lottery).  The bartender made us lemonades that were really tasty.\\n\\nWould add to my regular rotation of restos.', \"GET THE DUCK. It was the best duck I've had in my life. Perfectly cooked and came with a phenomenal Asian inspired char siu flavor sauce. The chef personally came to deliver the dish and explain everything. He even made a sausage out of the duck leg. \\n\\nThe PCT and patatas bravas were good tapas classics to add to the meal. Hefty portions! The hamachi tartare was also really delicious! Super refreshing with the blood orange flavor. Great hidden gem in the nomad area. It also seemed like they had an extensive wine list so I'll definitely be checking that out next time.\", 'Walked by and decided to check it this basement tapas spot.  Quaint place, nice bar and good service.  Had some wine, bouqerones, and a play on paella-forbidden rice with octopus.\\nIt was all very well put together.

I called in ahead of time for a group of 5 but we ended up with 6 ppl and they are quite accommodating.\\n\\nI had high expectations for the tapas but was very disappointed at a lot of them. We ordered 10 tapas including a special of the night (fried salmon with white beans). I was told the salmon would be flavorful, crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. However, it was bland and a lot drier. It was very average. \\n\\nFor other regular tapas on the menu: \\n\\n1. Shrimp Al Ajillo: 8/10 shrimp is tender and flavorful \\n2.

The inside of the restaurant was clean, nicely designed, and thoughtfully lighted.\\n\\nShrimp: nice amount of garlic, plump shrimps, and appropriately seasoned. It was perfect with bread.\\n\\nBroccolini: the pairing with citrus and crisply garlic was interesting. I appreciated the experimental thought but wasn't in love with it. Still, a very good veggie dish.\\n\\nPaella: loved this. The bottom of the rice was crispy and the kewpie mayo was a good addition. I thought the flavors complemented nicely. It could however been done with less oil. \\n\\nYum!\", \"I've been to Debajo a few times now and it's always an excellent experience! It's my favorite and go-to tapas restaurant in the city. The vibe is cozy and relaxed, the staff is always nice and accommodating and the food is so delicious. The pork, asparagus and octopus dishes are particular standouts. If you're in the area it's a must try!\", 'This is a tucked away little place just below ground.  The food was excellent as was the service.

My friend is GF and Mari had no problem going through the menu with us and pointing out what she can eat.

The heating in there is fantastic, I was able to show my arms for the first time since summer. \\n\\nService is great here - there was a constant flow of drinks and food all night. The cocktails are great as well as the food! I would recommend coming here and trying a bunch of different things.

Nice ambiance, and I could even take off my jacket without freezing! \\n\\nIt wouldn't be a proper visit to a Spanish tapas joint without starting out with a meat and cheese plate! I've recently discovered a love for Mahon cheese, and was very excited to see it on the menu here. I'm also partial to patatas bravas, and these were super tasty! Really enjoyed the garlic aioli combined with the bold salsa.\\n\\nI was undecided on trying either the sandwich de pollo or the gambas al ajillo (shrimp), so ended up getting both! The dishes are a decent portion, so I ended up taking most of the sandwich to go. Both were delicious - plus the gambas al ajillo came with probably 10 shrimp, A+ in my books as a huge shrimp lover! The sandwich de pollo was also very good, especially that buttery bread.\\n\\nAll in all, we had a great experience at Debajo! Service was also great, and food came out quickly despite the patio being full. Will have to come back again to try some desserts next time, too!\", \"This is some of the best food we've had in NY.

It seems like an acquired taste, but if you are adventurous, definitely give it a try. The Caju juice was refreshing.\\n\\nI ordered the Picanha which was cooked well and the powdery stuff that comes with it was really good.

Or try the Portuguese Chorizo Hash if you need meat-and-potatoes comfort. We tacked on the chicken and beef empanadas to fill up and weren't disappointed, esp. with the beef one.\\n\\nJust like in real Brazil, they offer a number of fresh fruit juices with several options you've probably never seen in this hemisphere.

Little bit expensive however. ..  . ................', \"NEW HIDDEN GEM. We were looking for a place to eat between lunch and dinner, most restaurants were packed or not open for service yet. As we were passing by, we saw this small cute restaurant and thought we would give it a try. We took a look at the menu, which was Brazilian and Portuguese dishes, which I haven't really tried either before so I was excited. We chatted with the owner (I think) and he said they opened 7 months ago! \\n\\nThis place is BYOB, so we decided to try their juices. I tried the pineapple and mint and my husband tried the apricot mango (my father in law tried the açai, not pictured). Out of all 3 the pineapple mint was the most refreshing and looked the prettiest! The guava didn't really have much flavor and was on the sour side. The açai juice was also good, I was told. \\n\\nWe pretty much ordered based off our waiters recommendations. For appetizers we tried the coxinha (chicken croquettes), pão de queijo (cheese bread), and the laranja bahia (orange salad). They were all good, loved the presentation and the different textures. The salad was my favorite, it was so refreshing and had crunchy nuts for added texture. The chicken croquettes were also really good, I'm glad they were small pieces because if larger they would be too heavy, perfect for sharing. And the cheese bread was great, it was bread stuffed with cheese, what more do you need! \\n\\nFor my main I had the polvo grelhado (grilled octopus and risotto). I love grilled octopus so this was great. One thing to note is the risotto had saffron, if you don't like saffron you might not like this dish. My husband had the salmon which was incredible, I would order this next time I visit. My father in law had the shrimp stroganoff which he enjoyed as well. It had Thai flavors which was nice and the shrimp was cooked well. \\n\\nFor dessert, the owner recommended the pastel de nata which is a Portuguese custard tart. It was served warm with a small scoop of ice cream and was delicious. Crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. I also had a latte; their coffees are really good! \\n\\nWhat I loved about this place was how they used authentic ingredients with their meals, which made the flavors more unique. Also shoutout to the waiters who were very accommodating and nice. Service was excellent. They entertained my 8 month old son as well! We will be coming back!\", \"We had a great experience, food is excellent.\\n\\nI wonder what happened to the Portuguese cafe that was here before? Since I think it's different owners.\\n\\nThere are about 8 tables inside and on a Saturday night by 7 they were all filled. I made a reservation for 6:30 for two people. We sat right away but one thing I saw happen is musical chairs with other tables. Waitress asked a couple of tables to switch to other tables as new people or reservations came in. It all worked out but looked disorganized. \\n\\nAlso the waiter and waitress were very nice but you need to flag them down to order or ask for water refill or really anything. Not once did they come up to ask our order, refill water or ask if everything was okay. It was fine to flag them down since it's a small place, and I think that system actually works well. \\n\\nWe had the meat and cheese plate which was amazing. Looked and tasted like what we have gotten before in Portugal. All the meats and cheeses were very fresh. It came with guava paste which is a Brazilian thing and it tasted very good when paired with the white cheese. Ham was on the honey dew, and I loved that. I liked the combo of salty, sweet and juicy. The cheese plate can feed 3-4, it was a lot for 2 people but we ate the whole thing! \\n\\nThen we shared the bacalou a bras. Which is salted cod mixed with potatoes. There are some olives and onions in there as well. In Portugal the potatoes where more crispy. I think the addition of onion here made it more watery and pastey. But either way the flavor was delicious. And I loved that they served rice with it as well.\\n\\nThe pastel de nata was very good and I liked it with the ice cream. Nothing compares to a pastel de nata from Porto but this was still good.  The brigadeiros tasted like average fudge. I've have these in São Paulo before and they were more dense and had a different texture, and were better. \\n\\nOverall great place to get Portuguese and Brazilian food. It's really cute and comforting inside. You feel like you're not in jersey city. It's BYOB and cool vines is a block away way, so my husband stepped out to get a bottle of wine. \\n\\nDef recommend!\", \"Lovely experience! The waiter was really attentive and helpful, food all around was great and they were able to accommodate our party of 9. The Fraldinha Grelhada is a must get. The inside is cute and there is indoor and outdoor seating. \\n\\nCan't wait to go back!\", 'Cute place with friendly service and nice ambiance. Food was good but was hoping for a bit more. Cheese bread, garlic shrimp were great. Picanha was good but a bit tough, same for the octopus.', \"Cute spot next to town hall. I definitely recommend booking a reservation because the restaurant is tiny. The best way to get a reservation is through their website, I don't suggest doing it through other apps or it might not show up.\\n\\nI went with my partner and two of our friends. We sat outside, which was beautiful because that sidewalk is slightly off the beaten path. \\n\\nFor appetizer we got the cheese bread and their crab dip (I think it was one of the specials). The crab dip came in an actual crab. Great presentation! And the cheese bread was delicious.\\n\\nFor my meal I got the steak with yucca fries. The steak was delicious, cooked perfectly, and came with a great sauce. The fries were a little tough, but that's expected with the style.\\n\\nMy partner got the beef stew, which is a huge dish. We wound up taking some of it home.\\n\\nOne of my friends got the octopus, which looks beautiful, but he said was tougher and chewier as you worked towards the thicker part of the tentacle. I wouldn't suggest it. Octopus can be tough to tenderize.\\n\\nWe didn't get dessert, but I did have their pineapple and mint drink. I highly suggest.\\n\\nThe place is byob and Cool Vines is right there. Get a bottle if you're in the mood.\", 'Everything about this cozy Brazilian restaurant is great.  As an honorary Brazilian who lives Part time in Salvador Bahia I cant say enough about this place.  Go for authentic cuisine (thats finally becoming more popular in the US)  it is worth a taste!\\nWarm Brazilian service followed by a very popular Pau de Quejo - freshly made cheese rolls + piping hot.

We weren't the biggest fan of the creamy coffee sauce that came with the Fraldinha Grelhada, although the steak and the fries were decent. (If you're not sure, get the sauce on the side!) The Picanha portion was HUGE! but albeit a little lackluster, primarily tasting like salt. That being said, for the quantity and quality of meat, the price is quite reasonable.\\n\\nThe interior was very cute and although the space is small, it is well-decorated with ambient decor and plenty of plants both inside and outside - would definitely recommend for a date night! Service was quick and friendly. If we were to come back, we'd love to try some tropical fruit juices on their menu.\", \"Fantastic hidden gem. Easy to get reservation (for now). Tomahawk is a must. Also liked octopus risotto. Octopus was well grilled with hint of fire. Small but didn't feel so small - I had big group (6ppl) and was able to comfortably sit. One thing - they don't sell any liquor so make sure you bring one for yourself!\", 'My friend Lucho and I went to Capoeira Restaurant at 24 Mercer Street, Jersey City, NJ today. The food persuasion is Brazilian / Portuguese . We truly enjoyed our lunch, appetizer and desserts. Photos here show what we indulged in. Besides the authentic meals, the servers Ludimyla and Maria were quite personable. Compliments as well to chef William.', \"First time trying Brazilian food and definitely enjoyed it. We came during their dinner menu, but it was still bright out so we got to enjoy their cute ambiance. (Photos of dining areas included, their bathroom is nice as well!)\\n\\nI ordered their grilled salmon with palm hearts risotto (Salmao Grelhado ao Molho de Maracujá), and let me tell you. Wait for the food to cool down first, and mix the risotto around to cool the food out evenly! Lol. I burnt my mouth a bit, but this dish was soooo yummy. The passion fruit sauce really ties the dish together as well. But I wasn't expecting the food to be so hot, the risotto was honestly still hot the whole time I was eating lol! Fresh out the kitchen for sure.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Picanha but I think there were a lot of fatty pieces that I watched him cut off. He said it was really good though. Also to add, he doesn't eat rice but it was included so if you're the same I would recommend ordering without the rice. * \\n\\nWe really enjoyed the fried yuca, and my mans said they were bangin LOL! The dipping sauce was so good too. Like a mayo mix of some sort. And he also ordered a side of their sauteed collard greens, which is a great side option to have. Our server was very nice and helped me figure out which drink options to try, and recommended their Guaraná soda, which reminded me of Guava and ginger ale! It was pretty good. We weren't a fan of their water (I'm assuming tap), and it's actually a BYOB restaurant, so I recommend bringing your own water/drinks!\\n\\nOverall great food, would come again but bringing our own water lol.\\n\\n* I took the rice home but it went bad pretty fast when I wanted to eat it for leftovers. So just don't order it so it won't go to waste!\", 'Capoeira Restaurant in Jersey City offers a delightful fusion of Brazilian flavors and ambiance.

Hidden gem that more people should know about!', \"Absolutely loved this place. Came here for a nice outdoor bday lunch, accommodated our whole party nicely - 4 adults and a toddler. Definitley recommend getting the Coxinha as an app (battered and fried shredded chicken balls) - add a little crunch to your lunch!

The food is delicious, unique, and reasonably priced. They are always adding things to make the decor even more charming. The chicken sandwich for lunch is my fave and their French onion soup is one of the best. I've come here quite often for lunch, breakfast, and dinner. Service is attentive and friendly. My only tip to the owners is they need to use a water filter, the drinking water tastes awful.\", 'Love love love. My wife is from Brazil and they made her feel at home! Would come back every week', 'What a delightful Portuguese / Brazilian restaurant find. Tucked snugly off a side street just to the left of a municipal building, this little eatery serves wonderful food in a clean, colorful and inviting atmosphere at reasonable prices.

Restrooms are single stall and meticulous. Recommended.', \"I love Brazilian food but unfortunately I didn't think this was a good representation of it, the rice and beans were very good.

I've been so exposed to ideologies and I can't remember if I want to go back to Rome, relearn Italian, re-delve myself into the farce of academic righteousness. Nothing in life matters. Not a fritto misto. Neither a branzino, nor a boar ragu. I am pale in the cold New York lack of sun. It gets dark at 4pm and that's when I saunter into Piccola Cucina with a couple on the brink of divorce. We smile and go with the motions. I order a negroni. I am enjoying this meal despite how sad and vacuous life is. No family. No pension. No retirement plan. I'm searching for meaning everywhere and seldom finding it. It's because art doesn't matter anymore and the young kids think I'm cynical.\\n\\nI appreciate Piccola Cucina for this reason. It's leaning on reality. It gives caring and meaning and low light and romance. Despite the couple I'm with! They are as cold to each other as the early sunset. I think to paint a sunset while eating fritto misto. I think it's the perfect winter dish. Vodka and fried food. The staff speaks Italian. I should ask them in Italian, who their favorite painter is. Which band they like the most. It is more likely that I will not have heard of them. That there is a lack of community. I don't know what art means anymore besides being relics of the 1990s. Everything is AI saturated and in the form of memes. Writing on Yelp, detailing a green squigly aldente pasta with boar meat being the new literature. Look, mom! I'm a contributor. I hope I imbue as much meaning here as Piccola Cucina brings a quiet but lovely night out in upper east NYC. A lovely dark early evening, I should say.\", \"Charming Italian spot in Midtown- I went for a work lunch with my team of 8 on a Friday, and it was quite full.\\nThere's an upstairs seating area as well, so lots of seating/can accommodate larger groups.\\n\\nService was prompt and very friendly. There was a birthday when we were there and they played happy birthday and sang happy birthday in Italian, which was pretty cool.\\n\\nFor food we shared some appetizers (arancini and meatballs)- very good, just not very share-able.\\nFor my main, I ordered the pappardelle with porcini mushroom- what a dreamy dish, it was so rich and decadent. Pasta was perfectly al dente.\\nGreat for a casual lunch\", \"This Italian restaurant is truly exceptional. The ambiance and decor create a warm, inviting atmosphere, and the bar seating offers a fantastic view of the action. We started with a few standout dishes: the lobster pasta, bolognese for my child, Caesar salad, octopus appetizer, and a perfectly fried rice ball filled with beef ragù and mozzarella. Each dish was a masterclass in flavor and preparation.\\n\\nThe Caesar salad was light and refreshing, providing a clean, crisp start to the meal. The lobster pasta was a particular highlight--beautifully flavored, with the lobster cooked to tender perfection and the pasta served al dente. The octopus was seasoned expertly and paired wonderfully with our chosen wine.\\n\\nFor dessert, we opted for ice cream and tiramisu. The tiramisu was prepared tableside, offering a delightful presentation. With its balanced coffee notes and subtle sweetness, it was a perfect end to the meal.\\n\\nEvery element of our dining experience was thoughtfully executed, from the flavors to the service. I would absolutely return to explore more of the menu and perhaps just enjoy a drink at the bar. This is a gem of a restaurant that's well worth visiting.\", 'Came here after a long drive.  Decide to stop by and pick some food up.  As soon as I entered I could tell this Italian restaurant was legit.  Everyone was including the customers were speaking Italian.  The hostess immediately greeted me and was very friendly.  She answered my two questions and put my order in.  I waited at the bar because the atmosphere was so cool. While I waited I noticed how happily everyone was speaking to each other.  It was a really happy atmosphere.  My food came out quickly.  I took it back.  When we took out the food, it looked delicious. We opened it up and ate it all.  It was amazing.  After this short experience, I want to come back here again and actually eat in the restaurant and try as many items on the menu as I can!!', \"This restaurant truly lived up to expectations! The complimentary bread was a nice touch, served with three flavorful sauces/toppings on the side.\\n\\nMust-try dishes:\\n * The octopus caprese with burrata, tomato confit, and basil was fantastic! The octopus was perfectly charred, paired beautifully with the creamy burrata, and drizzled with olive oil.\\n * The trio of raw fish--salmon, tuna, and scallop--was incredibly fresh, seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and capers for a clean bite.\\n * The green tagliatelle in wild boar ragù with truffles was good, though I would have loved a bit more truffle flavor.\\n * The paccheri with scampi, langoustine, lobster, and shrimp was a highlight. The pasta was cooked al dente, and there was a generous amount of seafood.\\n\\nThe pastas are shareable and come in large portions. I'd highly recommend this spot and look forward to returning to try more of the pasta dishes!\", \"One of my go to Italian restaurants, located conveniently near 59th Street Station and office buildings in midtown.

The cacio e Pepe was the best ever! The lasagna was over the top ! Saw this restaurant on instagram and had to try it! Make a reservation it's a small place. Full bar , great wine selections.

Be aware though-- they don't seat you until most of your party has arrived!!\\n\\nThe food was fantastic. Honestly, they had some of the best pastas and tiramisus I've had in a while. I loved everything we ordered-- the octopus was mouth-wateringly delicious, the caccio e peppe was creamy and great, the tiramisu was perfectly sweet. The lasagna and fish dishes were pretty good too.\", \"My first impression of Piccola Cucina was that I loved the vibes of the place because the atmosphere is so cute, cozy, and warm. Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed by the pasta. I ordered the paccheri ai tre crostacei aka the seafood pasta. I thought the sauce was bland, the seafood was overcooked, and the pasta was a little too al dente for me (I know that's a personal preference though). I will say the bread service was very good and probably my favorite part of the meal. Also, I appreciated how nice the waitress was and liked the complimentary biscotti with my tea. I think this is a good place to catch up with someone and to take home leftovers from, as the portions were huge. I'd probably go elsewhere when I'm prioritizing pasta though.\", 'Fast efficient service, good ambiance, great location, and the food and wines  were good. Tried different kinds of pasta there and everything was good quality. The service was really exceptionally friendly, looking forward to going back. Nothing on the menu really stood out to me though, just good solid Italian.', 'Wanted to try this place because of the advertised \"fresh pasta\". I wanted a seafood pasta and my waitress recommended Pachero ai tre crostacei (huge rigatoni looking noodles with lobster and shrimp in a red sauce) because it\\'s their most popular dish. This dish exceeded my expectations! The pachero was cooked al dente, which is the perfect texture. To my surprise, there was abundant shrimp and some lobster in the dish. The sauce was perfectly seasoned and left me scraping the pan for more. I loved how the dish was presented in a metal pan. Perhaps this helps retain the heat better. \\nOur appetizer was the arancini catanesi (rice balls) which was so crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside. This dish came out very quickly. \\nOverall I really enjoyed my meal. The servers were fast and attentive. The vibe was very homey and felt authentic. \\nWe were so full from our meal otherwise we would have ordered dessert! Will have to come back and try more dishes next time. Yum!', 'New spot just opened and I would say the ambiance and food did not disappoint. It was a great move. We liked the dishes we ordered', \"Came here for Sunday lunch with a reservation. The restaurant was pretty empty at noon so don't think the res was needed. We had the burrata and prosciutto to start, which was really delicious. The prosciutto was thinly sliced and great quality. I had an iced Americano which was very good. I had a Caesar salad for my main entree, which unfortunately was not my favorite. The dressing was overly salty and it was plated as if it was a wedge salad, so you had to cut it up and mix it yourself, which was difficult since the leaves were a bit soggy.\", 'This place came highly recommended and it does not disappoint. From their fresh homemade pastas to their desserts, this is a fantastic place to visit for all pasta lovers. They have the best tiramisu in NYC in my opinion, where the servers make it table side, with the perfect ratio of mascarpone and ladyfingers. I would definitely visit this place again!', \"Friends brought us to this place for a Christmas Eve dinner. Now...it's frequently not really fair to judge any place on a big holiday, eating with a large group. The kitchen is usually stressed...and sometimes the menu can be changed to a simpler one. Well...this place absolutely nailed the entire experience. From the second you come in the door, you are greeted like you are part of a Sicilian family. The service is impeccable, friendly and fast. The atmosphere is warm and cozy and has that FAMILY feel to it. Being a large group, our hosts opted to have plates brought to share...this way we were able to sample at least 13 different items from their impressive menu. EVERYTHING was beautifully presented and delicious. Protein, pastas and vegetables were all perfectly cooked, and thats really saying something. Bravo to the kitchen staff.  Some standout dishes for me were the  Arancini Catanese...the rice balls had actual ragu inside..not just meat or cheese...the sauce inside made it unnecessary to have a sauce to put on them. Fantastic. The Frito Misto was so perfectly fried...tender calamari that was super crisp and delicate...one of the pastas was an ossobuco filled ravioli with a veal sauce and pecorino fondue...I could have eaten the entire plate, possibly two...maybe the best ravioli I've ever tasted.  The branzino was absolutely wonderful.  There was also a potato dish that reminded me of fondant potatoes, but it wasn't. But they were so good, I'm still talking about them. I really must mention that this place has an excellent wine list. Our hosts are wine experts and chose astounding wines for us from their cellar. So if you are into wine this is definitely a place you must try. It's rare that any place can hit all homers, but this place did it effortlessly. If this is how they operate on a night that is likely high stress, I can't wait to see what they can do on a regular night. This is a definite revisit and I can't wait to try more items on their menu!  What a great way to spend Christmas Eve with friends!\", \"Highly recommended! I think it was one of the best Italian meals we've had. \\nA nice location near the park. We sat in the outside area, the restaurant inside is very quaint with two floors. \\nThe service was exceptional as was the food.

I was beyond angry and just needed a drink. My gf met me here because it was close to the gym and her home.\\n\\nWhen I got there, it was a bit awkward to be seated. I had to explain to them that I had someone coming but I'd like to eat and drink first. So they reluctantly gave me a seat. It took them like 20 min to take my order. I got the fritto misto and it was greasey and fishy. I was a bit grossed out by the dish so I had a few bites and asked them to clear it. They did make me a custom drink which was a limoncello martini that used casa amigos instead of vodka. They seemed to have thought it was odd, but my gf and I loved it. We each had two. I either didn't get the right dish or this place isn't for me. I don't think I will be going back here any time soon.\", 'My fiancée and I dined at Piccola Cucina and tried two dishes: the tagliatelle verdi con ragu di cinghiale (green tagliatelle in wild boar ragu) and the lemon herb ricotta gnocchi with scorpionfish.\\n\\nFood:\\nBoth dishes were great, but the tagliatelle was the true winner of the night. It was hearty, robust, and the black truffle on top made it spectacular. The gnocchi had a lovely lemony flavor, but unfortunately, the sauce was broken. Despite that, it was still very delicious.\\n\\nService:\\nHowever, the service experience left something to be desired. We arrived about 30 minutes early, but instead of seating us, the hostess stated, \"your table will be ready at 10 pm,\" which was our reservation time. It felt a bit odd, especially since they were able to accommodate three other walk-ins without any issues. Additionally, the staff interactions with us were quite short compared to how they engaged with other patrons.\\n\\nOverall, the food was enjoyable, but the service could use some improvement.', '10/10 for Piccola Cucina! This was exactly what I was looking for when I was seeking a small authentic Italian restaurant on my trip. After browsing many locations and many pictures I knew I had to give this spot a try. Piccola Cucina means \"Small Kitchen\".\\n\\nOne of the first things that stands out is the design out front, it\\'s warm and inviting. Entering the restaurant is a dream, it\\'s dimly lit, close quarters for everyone involved and filled with loud jovial conversation and the sound of forks touching dishes. You can tell everyone in the room is...happy.\\n\\nThe hostess sat us quickly. I\\'m pretty sure all staff members actively speak Italian so it certainly adds to the allure of the whole experience. The upstairs dining is a bit more modern inclusive of decor and music. I was honestly hoping to sit downstairs amongst the bustling atmosphere but they were packed. Upstairs was a bit quieter and more intimate. \\n\\nThe most inviting part about our seating was the table next to us, no lie, the older gentleman was raving to his table about how impressed he was with the food. He could not stop talking about the experience and thanking them for choosing Piccola Cucina. I couldn\\'t help but be excited.\\n\\nService was immaculate, from getting our beverages and food to the table quickly, but also asking us each time if we were ready for the next meal.\\n\\nI ordered the rice balls, and they were fresh, hot, well constructed and had a depth of flavor. I also ordered the lasagna and it tasted like someones grandma made it. It couldn\\'t be a more picture perfect experience. Also, honorable mention for the table bread, the sundried tomato and oil spread is the star of the show. \\n\\nIf you haven\\'t tried Piccola Cucina, stop in.

I think the food is truly the highlight, but I also enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant, as well as the service. \\n\\nI've been meaning to try more things on their menu, but I always find myself gravitating to the same items because of how good it is. Among my favorites include:\\n\\nWild Boar Tagliatelle with truffle 5/5: this is such a rich and delicious pasta. It tastes decadent because of the truffle and the wild boar has a ground beef kind of texture and taste, though a bit richer. This has never disappointed me.\\n\\nItalian ceviche with quinoa avocado 5/5: so delightful to share. The fish is fresh, and the light oil and lemon flavors go so well with the avocado and quinoa. \\n\\nEach meal comes with bread and some delicious dipping sauces and oils. Their desserts are also some of the best, including a tiramisu that they make at your table, and a special house made pistachio gelato (pictured). This place is definitely a splurge but I always enjoy coming here. Surprisingly, I've also been able to walk in occasionally without a reservation, though I do advise you make one in case!\", 'Friends and I when we were on 5th ave felling hungry and wanna try Italian food then open up yelp search for this restaurant, we order 2 pastas and one appetizer, only the appetizer grilled calamari and the squid ink pasta is good no the other one, service was good,she explains the food for us , decoration like in the 1980 .', \"I'm in an Italian food kick these days and I stumbled upon Piccola Cucina as I was looking for a restaurant near the Plaza Hotel. First off, the restaurant location is accessible and the ambiance is very inviting. While it is on the small side, they have enough seating and an option to sit on the second floor. The restaurant design is also vibey but feels classy. There is also a separate bar on the second floor.\\n\\nFoodwise, the lobster pasta I ordered was definitely 10/10! The serving looks small on the plate but it is actually the proper size to keep you full with proper space for the Tiramisu! I ordered the Tiramisu as they nake it fresh next to you. I am still dreaming of going back just for the Tiramisu alone. IT IS THAT DELICIOUS!!!!!\\n\\nThe service was also great. Waiters were attentive and friendly and know the menu very well.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place if you are uptown!\", 'Was here last week. It was everything I expected. Wonderful pasta. Intimate and romantic setting. Had the Caponata to start. Beautifully made with love. Loved it here', 'Great spot, great food, great ambiance/ vibe\\nBusy enough with a cozy vibe \\nFood was excellent, \\nMake reservations!! Well worth it', 'AMAZING pasta, good portions and flavor. We walked in on a week night over the summer and the place was already pretty busy. We were seated in the outdoor area which was fine as they kept the area cool.\\n\\nOrdered: 1. Green taligatelle- pasta with wild boar ragu tapped with black truffle.\\n2. Pacchero ait tre crostacei which was a scampi langoustine with lobster and shrimp.\\n\\nBoth dishes were BOMB, maybe a little heavy but sooo flavorful. We will definitely be back!', \"Amazing amazing food. Bread with the spreads were amazing. Specifically liked the tomato / caper mix.  Had the caico e pepe which was prepared table side in the cheese wheel. Great addition to the experience. Highly recommended\\n\\nMy only downside was the service. Other tables seemed to get pretty good service so not sure if it was just our waitress, but it was awful. Didn't get water or the bread for a good 30 minutes after being seated. We had to flag her down to put in our food order. Absolutely terrible. Otherwise I would have given this 5 stars.\", \"Piccola Cucina uptown was a random find that we found because we needed a place that would seat 2 fast, and this place ended up being a great surprise! They accommodated us so quickly, and the service in general was so friendly and personable and nice. The restaurant's vibes and ambiance felt like we were transported to a small mom and pop restaurant in Italy, with all the fun decor and so many employees being Italian. It was also great to see the manager/owner walking to each table to serve and also ask how our food and experience was. The food itself was very well made. I cannot recommend the zucchini flower starter enough it was delicious. The tiramisu was made table side, which was a cool experience. My favorite bite of the night though was the chocolate mouse dessert. It was spectacular!\", \"My favorite Sicilian restaurant in New York. It never disappoint. The service is excellent. Everyone greets you when you arrive and the manager walks around to check on every table make sure everyone got well taken care of. If our waiter was not around someone else would just jump in to help, makes everything seamless.\\n\\nI tried the Sicilian rice ball as appetizer, the beef ragu inside is so flavorful. Wrapped in a thin layer of rice coat and deep fried. It comes with two, big ping pong size good for two people to share. \\n\\nThe main I had Pacchero tre crostacei, it's a thick type of round tube pasta I'm not sure I'm a fan. But it's the same sauce as the other scampi pasta. It also comes with a piece of small langoustine and a piece of lobster. Size is perfect. \\n\\nMake sure to order the tiramisu, they come to your table to make it right in front of you, very fresh and very strong coffee.\", \"As a lover of Italian cuisine, I really enjoyed this restaurant. We sat at the bar, as it was a last minute decision to go there, and the place was fully booked.  The staff, mostly speaking in Italian to eachother, added a genuine touch to the authentic Italian ambiance.\\nThe service was exceptional, with our generously portioned meals arriving within a mere 15 minutes of ordering. But it wasn't just the speed that impressed me, there was a perfect harmony between the truffles an and the red sauce  in the Tagliatelle Verdi Con Ragu Di Cinghiale Alle Erbe E Tartufo Nero. \\nThe Fusilloni Di Gragnano Scampi was also delicious.\", \"One of my friends brought me here as it's one of her favorite restaurants in NYC, though she usually goes to the downtown location. After dining here, she said that she preferred that one, but I did enjoy this meal. I made reservations about a few days in advance for Saturday and they only had 4:45 PM and 9 PM left, so we dined early. I was surprised by how full it was even so early. \\n\\n+ Complimentary bread and dips ($0) - 10/10 - I love free stuff, and this was fantastic. The sundried tomato oil was my favorite, and I mostly used that with the delicious fresh bread. The carrots and hummus were fine. \\n\\n+ Octopus caprese ($28.95) - 7/10 - I didn't know how the octopus would come out; I thought it would be grilled, but if so, it is very mildly so. The burrata was nice but there was very little of it, and overall I ate this dish wishing there was more. The octopus was well-cooked but not as tender as I would have liked, and the green sauce (basil?) was quite good. Very much a deconstructed caprese with very little tomato confit. For this price, I think I'd much rather make my own. \\n\\n+ Fusilli with langoustine and burrata ($24.95) - 8/10 - My friend was disappointed as she says the downtown location is more tomato-forward. Overall, this was pretty good; I was not disappointed by it, and it did inspire me to make a lobster sauce since I have some homemade lobster stock at home and wasn't sure what to do with it. I felt that the bits of langoustine were more overcooked than to my liking, and again, the burrata was barely there. That said, I liked it enough that I want to make something like this (just with more burrata, more sauce, and more pasta). \\n\\nOverall, the meal was good, and I would recommend this if you don't know how to make food like this. I do think I can do better, but it provided  inspiration for me, so for me that's a good meal.\", \"Sicilian Italian cuisine at its finest with an extensive menu and a fantastic service provided during our dining experience. She was top notched and ever so kind. Because we just wanted to try this place even though we weren't hungry, so we shared the squid ink spaghetti with calamari. Great sauce and not heavy at all.\", \"Very delicious Italian spot! We came here Saturday night and I would recommend a reservation. The interior is rustic and cozy. We got the burrata to start, which was delicious. We also got the truffle focaccia but we would probably try something else next time. We also tried the taglietelle verde and the lobster fusilli. Both were amazing and I would recommend. Overall, I'd go again just for the burrata and two entrees!\", \"Wow, delicious. Great food, good atmosphere and friendly service. We had a reservation for two around 8 pm on a Saturday. We were seated right away. \\n\\nI started with an aperol spritz. Very yummy. We both ordered pasta as our main. We could have shared, the portions were a good size. I had the Pacchero with langoustine, lobster and shrimp. It came in a red sauce that was rich and tasty with good portions of all the seafood. My friend ordered a similar seafood pasta but with more cream in the sauce, the Fusilloni also served with langoustine. Both were delicious.\\n\\nWe ended with the tiramisu served table side. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan but there are some places where I enjoy the usually dry espresso cake and this is one of them. They prepare and assemble a single portion of tiramisu at your table that fits in a coffee cup. Perfect for two people to share. The healthy heaping of marscapone was to die for. I would come back just for dessert. \\n\\nAdding Piccola to my list of yummy Italian eats in New York.\", \"Service 5/5\\nAmbiance 5/5\\nFood 3.5/5\\n\\nI came here on a Wednesday evening with a friend. We didn't have a reservation but they had a table for 2 in their outdoor hut, which was VERY warm! (Except when people came in or out and didn't shut the door). We were seated immediately.\\n\\nWe got complimentary bread with 3 accompaniments: capers, sun dried tomatoes, and hummus. It was delicious. I got the  green tagliatelle and my friend ordered the lasagna. I thought my dish was pretty decent, but my friend thought the lasagna was too cheesy -- to the point where she couldn't even find the lasagna pieces because it was all cheese. We got cannoli on the house for dessert.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive and helpful, all the staff we interacted with were very professional. Overall, would recommend for the service and ambiance but the food was just okay.\", 'I was in the area and decided to stop by for lunch. It was so very busy, but was able to secure a spot at the bar. All in all, I enjoyed the food. I got the Gragnano Fusilli with Scampi Langoustine - the pasta was well cooked (a little bit al dente), the langoustine was succulent and well prepared, and the sauce was delicious. That being said, the highlight has to the best the sauces that accompanied the complementary bread, which made for a wonderful, unique experience. The only downside is that it is a bit expensive for the quantity of food. But all in all, it was a nice lunch experience. And certainly a good spot for a nice date or to treat family.', \"At first we were going to try some TikTok restaurant but decided to try a place closer that we hadn't seen so much online. THIS place doesn't need the exposure because it's already AMAZING without it.\\n\\nWOW! Quite possibly the best Italian food I've ever had in NYC. It tastes just like the food I've had in Italy. It's so elevated and everything is so beautifully made, like out of a movie. It's such a great restaurant, the ambiance was perfect, and the staff are so nice. Everything I had was amazing. The Tiramisu experience was very nice! Don't leave without it! I got the bruschetta and squash blossoms as an appetizer and it was delicious. For mains we got the lobster shrimp pasta and  I got the wild boar pasta. It was tasty, complex, with depth. For dessert we got the tiramisu and the lemon  cheesecake. A fantastic meal worth the trip. You won't regret it. Give it a try! I would definitely go again!\", \"We were disappointed by our dining experience here. Unfortunately the poor service made it hard to enjoy the meal. We wanted to start with focaccia with prosciutto but wound up with the plain one. Our pasta dishes did not come out together. Mine was brought out and I think the server assumed we were just sharing it. It seemed like we waited for quite some time before my friend's food was brought out. It didn't help that our waiter never really checked on us either. \\nI ordered green tagliatelle with boar ragu and my friend ordered the gnocchi. My dish was good but I liked the gnocchi better. It seemed very fresh and the zucchini flowers were a nice addition.\", \"Something that stuck out to me most here was the service. Everyone was so friendly, attentive, and hospitable!\\n\\nThe decor is so nice and fun - loved the tiles that have pasta inside them that are installed on the wall, and the shelves of different Italian ingredients and cookware! There is also some seating upstairs area that has a cool second bar sea\\n\\nThere is complimentary bread with different spreads (hummus, carrot, tomato). The salads are pretty solid to start off with. We were a party of 4 and shared 2 salads to start. \\n\\nMy favorite were the entrees. I read on some reviews beforehand so we knew we wanted to try the Tagliatelle verdi con ragù di cinghiale alle erbe e tartufo nero (aka Green Tagliatelle), which was so so worth it. It was delicious! We also ordered the Spaghetti al nero di seppia (Spaghetti with black squid ink sauce), which was also quite good. \\n\\nI ordered the Pappardelle ai funghi porcini which was good, but even for me a mushroom lover I found the mushroom flavor a bit overwhelming to eat by itself. The bread was a good palate cleanser, and I'm glad I got to try the other pasta dishes that my party ordered.\\n\\nI enjoyed the tiramisu dessert, which is a fun experience as the server prepares it by the table! \\n\\nI really enjoyed my dinner here, and am excited to come back sometime to try more of their dishes!\", 'What a great pasta place. You can tell immediately that the pasta is homemade and the sauces are made with love. Would highly recommend getting the pasta. The salmon was also delicious with a side of eggplant caponata. The one thing that was frustrating and would suggest to change is their menu. It was extremely unappealing to eyes as the font was small and there was so much writing, making it overwhelming to read. Also while is was nice to see them make the tiramisu right in front of you, the taste was not all there. I think it would be better to focus on the taste rather then presentation. Would recommend to a friend!', 'The green tagliatelle in wild boar Ragu with truffles was amazing and deserves a five star.  I had to dip into this pasta nonstop even though I am on a gluten free diet.  We will come back to try other house special pastas.\\n\\nThe grilled calamari was off, could be helpful to season the baby calamari or else the grill just adds some charred bitterness to the taste.  \\n\\nWe also ordered a salad with tuna and quinoa.  There is no flavor in the salad.  More thoughts and some dressing could rescue this dish.', 'The food was delicious and the service outstanding.  Online it indicates it has outside seating [which I believe they open in the evening], which is one reason we went to this restaurant [one of our party has an autoimmune disease].  It was not available and this was disheartening. But they were able to put us at a table right by the entry, so our party with the autoimmune disease felt relatively comfortable.  We still would have preferred the outside seating. Overall it was a lovely meal', \"My parents are both from Italy and they're both amazing cooks. I grew up in Italian restaurants my entire life. I have never had food as good as this! I usually shy away from going to Italian restaurants because they are most often a disappointment. This restaurant is something I think about every day since I dined here about a month ago. The service, the ambience, the food, and the bar cocktails were just PERFECTION! Most of Manhattan's restaurants that claim to be Italian are actually not. I rarely hear Italian spoken in any of them. If you're looking for authentic Italian food and the New York City experience, make a reservation now. The next time I'm in the city, this will be my first stop.\", \"I stopped here on a whim one night because I was looking for a place to eat solo and there was a free space at the bar. Truly loved it. The bartender was super helpful in suggesting wine to pair with my meal and everything I had was amazing. Every time I'm in New York, I make a point to stop here.\"]}]}\n"

      "Review Text: The food was amazing. Got the for 2 tasting menu. The salmon sashimi was very tasty. The fried items could have gone better just grilled and it was too dry.  The sushi rolls was good esp the shrimp tempura. The nabe was a great portion size and could add noodles. Lastly the tofu dessert was refreshing and light. Service was good they helped cook the nabe and scoop them into bowl for us.\n",

      "The restaurant gave me a sushi bar vibe when I first walked in. I loved the wooden tableware and the small stove that came out with the hotpot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the shabu shabu with beef, takowasabi, and yuzu miso salmon. They were all super delicious.\n",
      " \n",
      "The hotpot comes out warm ;therefore, you have to wait a few minutes for the broth to boil. There are separate black chopsticks for the raw meat. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was excellent! They would always come back to fill your water glass and soup base. They would help push down the vegetables and meat in the beginning when the soup is boiling to help you get started. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would come back again to try the sukiyaki and sushi!\n",

      "Really great, unique Japanese restaurant that specializes in Japanese hot pot. Our hot pot broth was rich and soothing in the cold temperature. I think they give you an appropriate portion for the number of people assuming you order at least one appetizer or other dish for the table. Kushiage were crispy and properly cooked inside. The bbq and mustard sauces were perfect for the skewers.\n",

      "Service was good. They checked on us, even replaced a skewer that fell to the floor. We got outdoor seating which was in a tent with a heater. It was comfortable.\n",
